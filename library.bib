abstract = {While spoken codeswitching (CS) among Latinos has received significant scholarly attention, few studies have examined written CS, specifically naturally-occurring CS in email. This study contributes to an under-studied area of Latino linguistic practices by reporting the results of a study of CS in the emails of five Spanish-English bilingual Latinos. Methods are employed that are not often used in discourse analysis of email texts, namely multi-dimensional scaling and tree diagrams, to explore the contextual parameters of written Spanish-English CS systematically. Consistent with the findings of other studies of CS in CMC, English use was most associated with professional or formal contacts, and use of Spanish, the participants' native language, was linked to intimacy, informality, and group identification. Switches to Spanish functioned to personalize otherwise transactional or work-related English-dominant emails. The article also discusses novel orthographic and linguistic forms specific to the CMC context.},

This article aims to investigate the use of Spanish-English by bilingual latinos in email communication. Only 5 participants were consulted, but the methods are/ were novel --multi-dimensional scaling and tree diagram analysis. The tentative results appear to concur with other studies: English is used as the lingua franca between interlocuters, but bilinguals tended to initiate emails in Spanish with other bilinguals. Use of Spanish tends to correlate with the intimate and community identification, whereas English forms the backbone for most communication.},

annote = {5-minute read summary

This paper aims to address an apparent gap in the literature concerning the study of code-switching in computer-mediated communication in English/Spanish. Using (small samples of) blogs, emails and social media (Facebook/ Twitter --specific user accounts), the author categorizes CS language into various categories. Of these categories, the one that is most-highly associated with all language sources (registers) is culturally-bound switches [isolated nouns, idiomatic expressions, discourse and identity markers].

This chapter provides an overview (ca. 2009) of language choice and CS on the internet. The survey provides an overview of various types of internet domains (chat, forums, etc.) and suggests that not all types show the same level of formality, and hence, the same degree of CS usage and/ or purpose.

Various studies are cited that consider register and language choice across modalities (written, spoken, CMC) --
(Biber, 1988) - spoken/ written
(Crystal, 2001) - internet types (CMS as "third medium")
(Androutsopoulos, 2006) - language choice and topic/ type of CS
(Hinrichs, 2006) - English as unmarked language of the internet},

annote = {5-minute read summary

This is an introduction to this special issue. It outlines the scope of the volume. The main goal is to investigate the relationship between CMC and spoken language. Bilingualism and code-switching is a key theme in this volume, again, comparing CMS and spoken language. It appears that in general the two are considered different animals, but there are aspects which appear to carry over. The Montes-Alcal{\'{a}} article appears in this volume. Another article of interest appears to be Margreet Dorleijn's article on a Dutch-Turkish corpus. The notion of recurring patterns interests me for the current project: what topics conveyed in a language (Spanish or English) and then how do mixed language posts compare?},

abstract = {This paper presents patterns of accentual alignment in two varieties of Spanish spoken in the Basque Country: Lekeitio Spanish (LS), with speakers whose other native language is Lekeitio Basque (LB); and Vitoria Spanish (VS), with monolingual speakers of Spanish from the city of Vitoria. These patterns are compared to those of Madrid Spanish (MS), compare Face (2002). In LS, accents are realized as pitch rises rather than falls, like in MS and unlike in LB, but peaks are aligned before the offset of the accented syllable, unlike in MS and like in LB. At the end of the subject phrase, peaks display later alignment, like in MS. Thus, LS displays mixed properties of Basque and Spanish intonation. In VS, stress is also realized as a tonal rise, with peaks aligned after the offset of the accented syllable, like in other varieties of Spanish and unlike LS. The low tone target is aligned before the onset of the stressed syllable, earlier than in LS and MS. The continuum of tonal target alignment is observed in LS, VS, and MS, and the difficulties in identifying a "starred" tone lead to a discussion of the suitability of the starred tone notation.},

abstract = {Both English and Spanish exhibit an inversion effect in wh-questions: a verbal element must appear to the left of the subject. Analyses differ, however, as to whether this effect is due to similar syntactic mechanisms in the two languages or not. The phenomenon of judgment satiation, in which certain unacceptable sentence types improve upon repeated exposure, is used here to provide new evidence addressing this issue. It is shown that unacceptable wh-questions in Spanish are susceptible to satiation, but their counterparts in English are not, thus suggesting that different mechanisms are responsible for the inversion effect in the two languages. In addition to providing new evidence regarding the nature of inversion in wh-questions, this study also constitutes a test case for using satiation in the service of comparative syntax.},

@article{Marsden2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Within the structural and grammatical bounds of a common language, all authors develop their own distinctive writing styles. Whether the relative occurrence of common words can be measured to produce accurate models of authorship is of particular interest. This work introduces a new score that helps to highlight such variations in word occurrence, and is applied to produce models of authorship of a large group of plays from the Shakespearean era.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY: A text corpus containing 55,055 unique words was generated from 168 plays from the Shakespearean era (16th and 17th centuries) of undisputed authorship. A new score, CM1, is introduced to measure variation patterns based on the frequency of occurrence of each word for the authors John Fletcher, Ben Jonson, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare, compared to the rest of the authors in the study (which provides a reference of relative word usage at that time). A total of 50 WEKA methods were applied for Fletcher, Jonson and Middleton, to identify those which were able to produce models yielding over 90{\%} classification accuracy. This ensemble of WEKA methods was then applied to model Shakespearean authorship across all 168 plays, yielding a Matthews' correlation coefficient (MCC) performance of over 90{\%}. Furthermore, the best model yielded an MCC of 99{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that different authors, while adhering to the structural and grammatical bounds of a common language, develop measurably distinct styles by the tendency to over-utilise or avoid particular common words and phrasings. Considering language and the potential of words as an abstract chaotic system with a high entropy, similarities can be drawn to the Maxwell's Demon thought experiment; authors subconsciously favour or filter certain words, modifying the probability profile in ways that could reflect their individuality and style.},

We collect a corpus of over three million food-related posts from Twitter and demonstrate that many latent population characteristics can be directly predicted from this data: overweight rate, diabetes rate, political leaning, and home geographical location of authors. For all tasks, our language-based models significantly outperform the majority-class baselines. Performance is further improved with more complex natural language processing, such as topic modeling. We analyze which textual features have most predictive power for these datasets, providing insight into the connections between the language of food, geographic locale, and community characteristics. Lastly, we design and implement an online system for real-time query and visualization of the dataset. Visualization tools, such as geo-referenced heatmaps, semantics-preserving wordclouds and temporal histograms, allow us to discover more complex, global patterns mirrored in the language of food.},

abstract = {The present study adds to our understanding of how learners employ lexical and grammatical phenomena to communicate in writing in different types of interlanguage discourse. A multidimensional (factor) analysis of a corpus of L2 Spanish writing (202,241 words) generated by second- and third-year, university-level learners was performed. The analysis uncovered four significant clusters that can be considered distinct discourse types with two main stylistic variations: narrative (characterized by verbal features) and expository (characterized by nominal features). Results also provide examples of the multiple ways that stylistic sophistication and linguistic complexity occur in the L2. Although the Spanish learners discourse did not show signs of syntactic complexity (e.g. frequent use of relative clauses, subordinate clauses, use of clitics), the frequent use of nominal features affects informational density due to the presence of numerous derivational morphemes. Inflectional complexity in the form of marked forms was not predominant in the data set. Still, the learners verbal inflections did vary, which is a sign of L2 development (Howard 2002, 2006; Collentine 2004; Marsden and David 2008).},

We present a pseudoword generator that improves on current methods. It allows for the generation of written polysyllabic pseudowords that obey a given language's phonotactic constraints. Given a word or nonword template, the algorithm can quickly generate pseudowords that match the template in subsyllabic structure and transition frequencies without having to search through a list with all possible candidates. Currently, the program is available for Dutch, English, German, French, Spanish, Serbian, and Basque, and, with little effort, it can be expanded to other languages.},

abstract = {Talk of linguistic universals has given cognitive scientists the impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of "universal," we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition. Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels. Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in human language opens up exciting new research directions for cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural experiments given by different languages, with new opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned with change and diversity, and confronting us with the extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills.},

It is available via the Internet at elexicon.wustl.edu. Data from 816 participants across six universities were collected in a lexical decision task (approximately 3400 responses per participant), and data from 444 participants were collected in a speeded naming task (approximately 2500 responses per participant). The present paper describes the motivation for this project, the methods used to collect the data, and the search engine that affords access to the behavioral measures and descriptive lexical statistics for these stimuli.},

This development has led to the collection of processing times and subjective ratings (of age of acquisition, concreteness, valence, and arousal) for most of the existing words in English and Dutch. In addition, a crowdsourcing study in the Dutch language has resulted in information about how well 52,000 lemmas are known. This information is likely to be of interest to NLP researchers and computational linguists. At the same time, large-scale measures of word characteristics developed in the latter traditions are likely to be pivotal in bringing the megastudy approach to the next level.},

annote = {In this article the authors layout a set of attributes and characteristics that are minimally required to define a corpus. The broad areas include the type of corpus, the range of language varieties, the time period, and whether to include writing and or speech in the corpus.

The authors comment on the importance of achieving a balanced corpus. However they also point out the pragmatic limitations in actually achieving balance in corpora. Their approach is to suggest that a corpus should be evaluated for its strengths and weaknesses and then modified to reflect this in order to approximate balanced and representative corpora. 

A very important point me in this article is that traditional statistical methods for sampling or not adequate for language corpora. The points include the fact that it is very difficult to delimit the total population of the corpus, there's no obvious unit of language which is to be sampled in a corpus, and finally the sheer size of the population causes problems.

Another key aspect in this article includes a discussion on the importance of reception that is the language that people here and read and production that is the language that people speak and write. Those texts that are easier to come by have a wide reception. Yet, it is important to make an effort to include as much production material as possible. 

In describing the population the authors make a distinction between internal criteria, those which are essentially linguistic and external criteria, those which are essentially non-linguistic.

They also comment on issues dealing with Johndra and topic and the difficulty in distinguishing between Johndra and topic. They suggest that topics and/or genres are better described through a network then buy some type of hierarchy.},

Subjects in the control group rated unrelated sentences during the exposure period before rating the experimental sentences. Subjects in the Experimental group rated both grammatical and ungrammatical sentences as more acceptable after repeated evaluation than subjects in the Control group. In Experiment 2, subjects answered a comprehension question after reading each sentence during the exposure period. Subjects in the experimental group rated garden path and center-embedded (1) sentences as higher in acceptability after comprehension exposure than subjects in the control group. The results are consistent with increased fluency of comprehension being misattributed as a change in acceptability.},

This paper aims to address an apparent gap in the literature concerning the study of code-switching in computer-mediated communication in English/Spanish. Using (small samples of) blogs, emails and social media (Facebook/ Twitter --specific user accounts), the author categorizes CS language into various categories. Of these categories, the one that is most-highly associated with all language sources (registers) is culturally-bound switches [isolated nouns, idiomatic expressions, discourse and identity markers].

Our ability to communicate relies in part upon a shared emotional experience, with stories often following distinct emotional trajectories, forming patterns that are meaningful to us. Here, by classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 1,737 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a set of six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex narratives. We strengthen our findings by separately applying optimization, linear decomposition, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. For each of these six core emotional arcs, we examine the closest characteristic stories in publication today and find that particular emotional arcs enjoy greater success, as measured by downloads.},

abstract = {Language in social media is rich with linguistic innovations, most strikingly in the new words and spellings that constantly enter the lexicon. Despite assertions about the power of social media to connect people across the world, we find that many of these neologisms are restricted to geographically compact areas. Even for words that become ubiquituous, their growth in popularity is often geographical, spreading from city to city. Thus, social media text offers a unique opportunity to study the diffusion of lexical change. In this paper, we show how an autoregressive model of word frequencies in social media can be used to induce a network of linguistic influence between American cities. By comparing the induced network with the geographical and demographic characteristics of each city, we can measure the factors that drive the spread of lexical innovation.},

In a previous study, I reviewed many of these measures and suggested an alternative measure, DP (for 'deviation of proportions'), which I argued to be conceptually simpler and more versatile than many competing measures. However, despite the relevance of dispersion for virtually all corpus-linguistic work, it is still a very much under-researched topic: to the best of my knowledge, there is not a single study investigating how different measures compare to each other when applied to large datasets, nor is there any work that attempts to determine how different measures match up with the kind of psycholinguistic data that dispersions and adjusted frequencies are supposed to represent. This article takes exploratory steps in both of these directions.},

abstract = {Cities are complex systems, a particular dimension largely contributing to the complexity of cities is detected in the multiplicity of the behaviour of people who inhabit. In the urban con- text, these behaviours can be inferred from human activities. Understanding the distinctions of these activities between cities is crucial. Previous works carry out such studies using sur- veys, censuses, interviews and onsite observations, which are rather costly, requiring extensive human or other resources. With the development of Internet and information technology, the geo-referenced social media networks which link human activities to specific places have been more and more popular. It, therefore, becomes a good candidate for studying individual human activities in the city. In this work, we explore to what extent can social media data be used for studying differences of individual human activities in an urban environment, considering im- pacts of three aspects: the choice of social media platforms, the user roles and demographics, and the various of Point of Interests (PoIs). To perform this study, we design an experiment to compare user activities on multiple social media platforms in Rotterdam and Shenzhen. A pipeline for crawling and enrichingWeibo data is developed and encapsulated as an extension to the Social-Glass framework. A novel dataset containing data from four platforms (i.e. Twit- ter, Instagram, Foursquare andWeibo) in two cities for two weeks is created and analysed at a disaggregate level across several dimensions. Results indicate that, in the context of user ac- tivity study, Twitter andWeibo shows distinct differences for resident regarding local, general, and neutral topics particularly for young and mid-age users on Twitter, and for teen and young users onWeibo. While, Instagram shows evident differences for non-residents concerning in- ternational, specific, daily and emotional topics, especially for young and mid-age users. In the meantime, various PoIs provide significant differences in user activity. Thesis},

abstract = {Greek speakers say "omicronupsilonrho", Germans "schwanz" and the French "queue" to describe what English speakers call a 'tail', but all of these languages use a related form of 'two' to describe the number after one. Among more than 100 Indo-European languages and dialects, the words for some meanings (such as 'tail') evolve rapidly, being expressed across languages by dozens of unrelated words, while others evolve much more slowly--such as the number 'two', for which all Indo-European language speakers use the same related word-form. No general linguistic mechanism has been advanced to explain this striking variation in rates of lexical replacement among meanings. Here we use four large and divergent language corpora (English, Spanish, Russian and Greek) and a comparative database of 200 fundamental vocabulary meanings in 87 Indo-European languages to show that the frequency with which these words are used in modern language predicts their rate of replacement over thousands of years of Indo-European language evolution. Across all 200 meanings, frequently used words evolve at slower rates and infrequently used words evolve more rapidly. This relationship holds separately and identically across parts of speech for each of the four language corpora, and accounts for approximately 50{\%} of the variation in historical rates of lexical replacement. We propose that the frequency with which specific words are used in everyday language exerts a general and law-like influence on their rates of evolution. Our findings are consistent with social models of word change that emphasize the role of selection, and suggest that owing to the ways that humans use language, some words will evolve slowly and others rapidly across all languages.},

Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 133, 283-316] studied lexical processing in word naming and lexical decision using hierarchical multiple regression techniques for a large data set of monosyllabic, morphologically simple words. The present study supplements their work by making use of more flexible regression techniques that are better suited for dealing with collinearity and non-linearity, and by documenting the contributions of several variables that they did not take into account. In particular, we included measures of morphological connectivity, as well as a new frequency count, the frequency of a word in speech rather than in writing. The morphological measures emerged as strong predictors in visual lexical decision, but not in naming, providing evidence for the importance of morphological connectivity even for the recognition of morphologically simple words. Spoken frequency was predictive not only for naming but also for visual lexical decision. In addition, it co-determined subjective frequency estimates and norms for age of acquisition. Finally, we show that frequency predominantly reflects conceptual familiarity rather than familiarity with a word's form. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {This paper examines a number of communication strategies that are deployed by EFL learners when writing English. Students learning a foreign language do not, of course, have a complete repertory of vocabulary and grammar; therefore, when faced with the need for a word that they do not know, they will try to resolve any ambiguity by deploying various communication strategies. These strategies include using approximations of meaning or circumlocutions, or simply switching to their mother tongue. Most studies in this field have been in the form of episodic reference. This study, however, focuses on the types of communication strategy that are most frequently used by certain EFL learners in a given situation, and on why those strategies are preferred. This study offers an analysis of a task-based corpus that was created specifically for this purpose.},

abstract = {Megastudies with processing efficiency measures for thousands of words allow researchers to assess the quality of the word features they are using. In this article, we analyse reading aloud and lexical decision reaction times and accuracy rates for 2,336 words to assess the influence of subjective frequency and age of acquisition on performance. Specifically, we compare newly presented word frequency measures with the existing frequency norms of Kucera and Francis (1967), HAL (Burgess {\&} Livesay, 1998), Brysbaert and New (2009), and Zeno, Ivens, Millard, and Duvvuri (1995). We show that the use of the Kucera and Francis word frequency measure accounts for much less variance than the other word frequencies, which leaves more variance to be "explained" by familiarity ratings and age-of-acquisition ratings. We argue that subjective frequency ratings are no longer needed if researchers have good objective word frequency counts. The effect of age of acquisition remains significant and has an effect size that is of practical relevance, although it is substantially smaller than that of the first phoneme in naming and the objective word frequency in lexical decision. Thus, our results suggest that models of word processing need to utilize these recently developed frequency estimates during training or setting baseline activation levels in the lexicon.},

Different languages can be a barrier between monolingual communities, and the dynamics of language choice could explain the prosperity or demise of local languages in an in- ternational setting. We study this interplay of language and net- work structure in diverse, multi-lingual societies, using Twitter. In our analysis, we are particularly interested in the role of bilinguals. Concretely, we attempt to quantify the degree to which users are the “bridge-builders” between monolingual language groups, while monolingual users cluster together. Also, with the revalidation of English as a lingua franca on Twitter, we reveal users of the native non-English language have higher influence than English users, and the language convergence pattern is consistent across the regions. Furthermore, we explore for which topics these users prefer their native language rather than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest sociolinguistic study in a network setting.},

We present a corpus-based analysis of the lexico-grammatical features co-occurring with copula + adjective usage among foreign-language learners of Spanish at three levels of instruction. Findings revealed the following: (a) bothser+ adjective andestar+ adjective occur at all levels where little linguistic complexity typically occurs; (b)ser+ adjective appears in descriptive and evaluative discourse; and (c)estar+ adjective is present in narrations, descriptions, and hypothetical discourse.},

abstract = {Corpus-based Translation Studies focuses on translation as a product by comparing comparable corpora of translated and non-translated texts. A number of distinctive features of translations have been posited including, for example, explicitation, simplification, normalisation, levelling out, source language interference, and under-representation of target language unique items. Nevertheless, research of this area has until recently been confined largely to translational English and closely related European languages. If the features of translational language that have been reported on the basis of these languages are to be generalised as 'translation universals', the language pairs involved must not be restricted to English and closely related European languages. Clearly, evidence from a genetically distant language pair such as English and Chinese is arguably more convincing, if not indispensable. This article explores, in the broad context of translation universal research, lexical and grammatical properties of translational Chinese on the basis of two one-million-word balanced comparable corpora of translated and non-translated native Chinese texts. The findings of this empirical study of the properties of translational Chinese have enabled a reevaluation, from the perspective of translational Chinese, of largely English-based translation universal hypotheses.

Even the commas are not absolutely required. The strength of preference for them depends on how heavy the modifiers are: cf. strength judicially applied increases the effectiveness of diplomacy, a cup of peanuts unshelled in the stock adds character. 3 In short, the structure (3) seems to be best characterized as grammatical, though it violates any number of parsing preferences and is completely absurd.

Key to this analysis is the use of the computational tool Coh-Metrix, which measures cohesion and text difficulty at various levels of language, discourse, and conceptual analysis, and a statistical method known as discriminant function analysis. Results show that L1 and L2 written texts vary in several dimensions related to the writer's use of lexical choices. These dimensions correlate to lexical depth of knowledge, variation, and sophistication. These findings, together with the relevance of the new computational tools for the text analysis used in the study, are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A multidimensional (factor) analysis of a corpus of L2 Spanish writing (202,241 words) generated by second- and third-year, university-level learners was performed. The analysis uncovered four significant clusters that can be considered distinct discourse types with two main stylistic variations: narrative (characterized by verbal features) and expository (characterized by nominal features). Results also provide examples of the multiple ways that stylistic sophistication and linguistic complexity occur in the L2. Although the Spanish learners discourse did not show signs of syntactic complexity (e.g. frequent use of relative clauses, subordinate clauses, use of clitics), the frequent use of nominal features affects informational density due to the presence of numerous derivational morphemes. Inflectional complexity in the form of marked forms was not predominant in the data set. Still, the learners verbal inflections did vary, which is a sign of L2 development (Howard 2002, 2006; Collentine 2004; Marsden and David 2008).},

abstract = {Individual happiness is a fundamental societal metric. Normally measured through self-report, happiness has often been indirectly characterized and overshadowed by more readily quantifiable economic indicators such as gross domestic product. Here, we examine expressions made on the online, global microblog and social networking service Twitter, uncovering and explaining temporal variations in happiness and information levels over timescales ranging from hours to years. Our data set comprises over 46 billion words contained in nearly 4.6 billion expressions posted over a 33 month span by over 63 million unique users. In measuring happiness, we construct a tunable, real-time, remote-sensing, and non-invasive, text-based hedonometer. In building our metric, made available with this paper, we conducted a survey to obtain happiness evaluations of over 10,000 individual words, representing a tenfold size improvement over similar existing word sets. Rather than being ad hoc, our word list is chosen solely by frequency of usage, and we show how a highly robust and tunable metric can be constructed and defended.},

Seventy one non-college-bound 16-24 year-old speakers of English completed a battery of 18 verbal and cognitive skill assessments, and read a series of sentences as their eye movements were monitored. Statistical analyses were performed to establish what tests of reading abilities were predictive of eye-movement patterns across this population and how strong the effects were. We found that individual scores in rapid automatized naming and word identification tests (i) were the only participant variables with reliable predictivity throughout the time-course of reading; (ii) elicited effects that superceded in magnitude the effects of established predictors like word length or frequency; and (iii) strongly modulated the influence of word length and frequency on fixation times. We discuss implications of our findings for testing reading ability, as well as for research of eye-movements in reading.},

@article{Gong2016,
abstract = {Cities are complex systems, a particular dimension largely contributing to the complexity of cities is detected in the multiplicity of the behaviour of people who inhabit. In the urban con- text, these behaviours can be inferred from human activities. Understanding the distinctions of these activities between cities is crucial. Previous works carry out such studies using sur- veys, censuses, interviews and onsite observations, which are rather costly, requiring extensive human or other resources. With the development of Internet and information technology, the geo-referenced social media networks which link human activities to specific places have been more and more popular. It, therefore, becomes a good candidate for studying individual human activities in the city. In this work, we explore to what extent can social media data be used for studying differences of individual human activities in an urban environment, considering im- pacts of three aspects: the choice of social media platforms, the user roles and demographics, and the various of Point of Interests (PoIs). To perform this study, we design an experiment to compare user activities on multiple social media platforms in Rotterdam and Shenzhen. A pipeline for crawling and enrichingWeibo data is developed and encapsulated as an extension to the Social-Glass framework. A novel dataset containing data from four platforms (i.e. Twit- ter, Instagram, Foursquare andWeibo) in two cities for two weeks is created and analysed at a disaggregate level across several dimensions. Results indicate that, in the context of user ac- tivity study, Twitter andWeibo shows distinct differences for resident regarding local, general, and neutral topics particularly for young and mid-age users on Twitter, and for teen and young users onWeibo. While, Instagram shows evident differences for non-residents concerning in- ternational, specific, daily and emotional topics, especially for young and mid-age users. In the meantime, various PoIs provide significant differences in user activity. Thesis},

abstract = {In this study we examine linguistic variation and its dependence on both social and geographic factors. We follow dialectometry in applying a quantitative methodology and focusing on dialect distances, and social dialectology in the choice of factors we examine in building a model to predict word pronunciation distances from the standard Dutch language to 424 Dutch dialects. We combine linear mixed-effects regression modeling with generalized additive modeling to predict the pronunciation distance of 559 words. Although geographical position is the dominant predictor, several other factors emerged as significant. The model predicts a greater distance from the standard for smaller communities, for communities with a higher average age, for nouns (as contrasted with verbs and adjectives), for more frequent words, and for words with relatively many vowels. The impact of the demographic variables, however, varied from word to word. For a majority of words, larger, richer and younger communities are moving towards the standard. For a smaller minority of words, larger, richer and younger communities emerge as driving a change away from the standard. Similarly, the strength of the effects of word frequency and word category varied geographically. The peripheral areas of the Netherlands showed a greater distance from the standard for nouns (as opposed to verbs and adjectives) as well as for high-frequency words, compared to the more central areas. Our findings indicate that changes in pronunciation have been spreading (in particular for low-frequency words) from the Hollandic center of economic power to the peripheral areas of the country, meeting resistance that is stronger wherever, for well-documented historical reasons, the political influence of Holland was reduced. Our results are also consistent with the theory of lexical diffusion, in that distances from the Hollandic norm vary systematically and predictably on a word by word basis.},

In this paper, we target out-of-vocabulary words in short text messages and propose a method for identifying and normalising ill-formed words. Our method uses a classifier to detect ill-formed words, and generates correction candidates based on morphophonemic similarity. Both word similarity and context are then exploited to select the most probable correction candidate for the word. The proposed method doesnt require any annotations, and achieves state-of-the-art performance over an SMS corpus and a novel dataset based on Twitter.},

@article{Xiao2014,
abstract = {Corpus-based Translation Studies focuses on translation as a product by comparing comparable corpora of translated and non-translated texts. A number of distinctive features of translations have been posited including, for example, explicitation, simplification, normalisation, levelling out, source language interference, and under-representation of target language unique items. Nevertheless, research of this area has until recently been confined largely to translational English and closely related European languages. If the features of translational language that have been reported on the basis of these languages are to be generalised as 'translation universals', the language pairs involved must not be restricted to English and closely related European languages. Clearly, evidence from a genetically distant language pair such as English and Chinese is arguably more convincing, if not indispensable. This article explores, in the broad context of translation universal research, lexical and grammatical properties of translational Chinese on the basis of two one-million-word balanced comparable corpora of translated and non-translated native Chinese texts. The findings of this empirical study of the properties of translational Chinese have enabled a reevaluation, from the perspective of translational Chinese, of largely English-based translation universal hypotheses.

It analyzes the discourse functions of interrogative allo-repetitions in a corpus of oral Mexican Spanish from the perspective of both their conversational role as repair mechanisms and as linguistic strategies to convey politeness or impoliteness in interaction. The main findings of this research are that interrogative allo-repetitions fulfill different politeness (i.e. face-saving, face-flattering, or face-threatening) strategies depending not only on their conversational function (true vs. fictitious repair mechanisms), but also and most importantly on the type of verbal interaction and cultural settings in which they take place, as well as the relationship between participants.},

Since then SRILM has found wide use in the speech and natural language research community. A 2002 paper [1] presented an overview of the toolkit's design and functionality, of which we provide only a brief summary here. This paper takes stock of SRILM developments since then, as well as extensions and applications of SRILM. We also summarize activities in the SRILM user community, give an overall assessment of developments so far, and point out possible future directions.},

abstract = {Megastudies with processing efficiency measures for thousands of words allow researchers to assess the quality of the word features they are using. In this article, we analyse reading aloud and lexical decision reaction times and accuracy rates for 2,336 words to assess the influence of subjective frequency and age of acquisition on performance. Specifically, we compare newly presented word frequency measures with the existing frequency norms of Kucera and Francis (1967), HAL (Burgess {\&} Livesay, 1998), Brysbaert and New (2009), and Zeno, Ivens, Millard, and Duvvuri (1995). We show that the use of the Kucera and Francis word frequency measure accounts for much less variance than the other word frequencies, which leaves more variance to be "explained" by familiarity ratings and age-of-acquisition ratings. We argue that subjective frequency ratings are no longer needed if researchers have good objective word frequency counts. The effect of age of acquisition remains significant and has an effect size that is of practical relevance, although it is substantially smaller than that of the first phoneme in naming and the objective word frequency in lexical decision. Thus, our results suggest that models of word processing need to utilize these recently developed frequency estimates during training or setting baseline activation levels in the lexicon.},

abstract = {Finnish has a very productive morphology in which a stem can give rise to several thousand words. This study presents a visual lexical decision experiment addressing the processing consequences of the huge productivity of Finnish morphology. The authors observed that in Finnish words with larger morphological families elicited shorter response latencies. However, in contrast to Dutch and Hebrew, it is not the complete morphological family of a complex Finnish word that codetermines response latencies but only the subset of words directly derived from the complex word itself. Comparisons with parallel experiments using translation equivalents in Dutch and Hebrew showed substantial cross-language predictivity of family size between Finnish and Dutch but not between Finnish and Hebrew, reflecting the different ways in which the Hebrew and Finnish morphological systems contribute to the semantic organization of concepts in the mental lexicon.},

This development has led to the collection of processing times and subjective ratings (of age of acquisition, concreteness, valence, and arousal) for most of the existing words in English and Dutch. In addition, a crowdsourcing study in the Dutch language has resulted in information about how well 52,000 lemmas are known. This information is likely to be of interest to NLP researchers and computational linguists. At the same time, large-scale measures of word characteristics developed in the latter traditions are likely to be pivotal in bringing the megastudy approach to the next level.},

abstract = {Quantifying the degree of spatial dependence for linguistic variables is a key task for analyzing dialectal variation. However, existing approaches have important drawbacks. First, they make unjustified assumptions about the nature of spatial variation: some assume that the geographical distribution of linguistic variables is Gaussian, while others assume that linguistic variation is aligned to pre-defined geopolitical units such as states or counties. Second, they are not applicable to all types of linguistic data: some approaches apply only to frequencies, others to boolean indicators of whether a linguistic variable is present. We present a new method for measuring geographical language variation, which solves both of these problems. Our approach builds on reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) representations for nonparametric statistics, and takes the form of a test statistic that is computed from pairs of individual geotagged observations without aggregation into predefined geographical bins. We compare this test with prior work using synthetic data as well as a diverse set of real datasets: a corpus of Dutch tweets, a Dutch syntactic atlas, and a dataset of letters to the editor in North American newspapers. Our proposed test is shown to support robust inferences across a broad range of scenarios and types of data.},

The method is framed in a construction-based approach to language, i.e. it assumes that grammar consists of signs (form-meaning pairs) and is thus not fundamentally different from the lexicon. Themethod is applied to linguistic expressions at various levels of abstraction (words, semi-fixed phrases, argument structures, tense, aspect and mood). Themethod has two main applications: first, to increase the adequacy of grammatical description by providing an objective way of identifying themeaning of a grammatical construction and determining the degree to which particular slots in it prefer or are restricted to a particular set of lexemes; second, to provide data for linguistic theory-building.},

The goal is to use the corpus, among other things, as a new gold standard for training and testing PoS taggers. We describe the individual phases of the corpus construction, i.e. text selection and cleaning, sentence segmentation and tokenisation, PoS tagging with a combination method, error detection, and error correction. Furthermore, we discuss what problems have emerged, highlight which software tools have been found to be useful, and identify which tools are re-usable across different languages. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the error detection programs are effective and that our tagger combination method is crucial with regard to the amount of hand-correction that must be carried out in future work. We believe that our work will be of help to those wishing to develop similar resources for less-resourced languages.},

abstract = {Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a theory and method for extracting and representing the contextual-usage meaning of words by statistical computations applied to a large corpus of text (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). The underlying idea is that the aggregate of all the word contexts in which a given word does and does not appear provides a set of mutual constraints that largely determines the similarity of meaning of words and sets of words to each other. The adequacy of LSA's reflection of human knowledge has been established in a variety of ways. For example, its scores overlap those of humans on standard vocabulary and subject matter tests; it mimics human word sorting and category judgments; it simulates word–word and passage–word lexical priming data; and, as reported in 3 following articles in this issue, it accurately estimates passage coherence, learnability of passages by individual students, and the quality and quantity of knowledge contained in an essay.},

@article{Nguyen2016a,
abstract = {Quantifying the degree of spatial dependence for linguistic variables is a key task for analyzing dialectal variation. However, existing approaches have important drawbacks. First, they make unjustified assumptions about the nature of spatial variation: some assume that the geographical distribution of linguistic variables is Gaussian, while others assume that linguistic variation is aligned to pre-defined geopolitical units such as states or counties. Second, they are not applicable to all types of linguistic data: some approaches apply only to frequencies, others to boolean indicators of whether a linguistic variable is present. We present a new method for measuring geographical language variation, which solves both of these problems. Our approach builds on reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) representations for nonparametric statistics, and takes the form of a test statistic that is computed from pairs of individual geotagged observations without aggregation into predefined geographical bins. We compare this test with prior work using synthetic data as well as a diverse set of real datasets: a corpus of Dutch tweets, a Dutch syntactic atlas, and a dataset of letters to the editor in North American newspapers. Our proposed test is shown to support robust inferences across a broad range of scenarios and types of data.},

abstract = {Mixed language data is one of the difficult yet less explored domains of natural language processing. Most research in fields like machine translation or sentiment analysis assume monolingual input. However, people who are capable of using more than one language often communicate using multiple languages at the same time. Sociolinguists believe this "code-switching" phenomenon to be socially motivated. For example, to express solidarity or to establish authority. Most past work depend on external tools or resources, such as part-of-speech tagging, dictionary look-up, or named-entity recognizers to extract rich features for training machine learning models. In this paper, we train recurrent neural networks with only raw features, and use word embedding to automatically learn meaningful representations. Using the same mixed-language Twitter corpus, our system is able to outperform the best SVM-based systems reported in the EMNLP'14 Code-Switching Workshop by 1{\%} in accuracy, or by 17{\%} in error rate reduction.},

@article{Mitchell2008,
abstract = {This project had two main aims: to create a small scale, high quality database of spoken learner Spanish, as a new resource for the study of second language acquisition, and to undertake a short programme of substantive research, using the new database. Spoken Spanish data have been collected from classroom learners in schools and universities in England, using a series of specially designed elicitation tasks, including storytelling, picture description, discussion and individual interview. There were 20 learners at each of 3 levels: beginners (Year 9 students aged 13-14), intermediate students (A2 students aged 17-18), and fourth year undergraduates. All of them were native English speakers. Depending on their level, each learner was audiorecorded undertaking between 3 and 5 oral tasks. They also completed computer based and paper based tasks which provided complementary data on aspects of their Spanish knowledge. For comparison purposes, small numbers of native speakers were also recorded undertaking the same tasks. The resulting database contains 290 digital soundfiles (240 learner recordings, 50 native speaker recordings). These are accompanied by transcripts in CHILDES (Child Language Data Exchange System) format, which can be analysed with linguistic analysis software (CLAN). Some files have an extra layer of tagging which identifies parts of speech. A project website has been created and the material has been made freely available in anonymised form through the website, for use by other second language acquisition researchers. The website can be viewed at www.splloc.soton.ac.uk. The substantive research programme undertaken so far has investigated the acquisition of two central features of Spanish grammar which differ from English, i.e. word order in sentences (more fixed in English, more variable in Spanish), and the pronoun system (Spanish object pronouns are marked for gender, and generally precede the verb). The third substantive issue investigated to date is the development of Spanish vocabulary. The investigation of learners developing control of Spanish pronouns has been based on two tasks (picture based production task, and computer based interpretation task). The performance of learners at all three levels has been compared on this issue. The results show that beginner and intermediate learners tend to avoid the use of pronouns, preferring to use full noun phrases in their place. However, once they start to use pronouns, learners usage tends to be accurate, and the advanced learners achieve high levels of accuracy (75 per cent in the production task, 90 per cent in the interpretation task). These findings are important for second language acquisition theory, because they are relevant to a central debate regarding the source(s) of learner errors, and the extent to which learners can ever develop a native speaker like grammar system. The findings support the view that learners can and do acquire a correct underlying representation of Spanish grammar, and early errors in their performance are due to other problems such as processing limitations or communicative pressures. The investigation of learners developing control of Spanish word order is relevant to another central discussion in SLA theory. Spanish word order is variable, with subjects both preceding and following verbs, in varying circumstances. The different possibilities are controlled by two interacting factors: a) the grammar associated with particular types of verb, and b) the kind of information being conveyed (broad or narrow focus). Different explanations have been advanced previously for the difficulties learners encounter with this system. Does the problem lie in the underlying grammar system, or do the learners have difficulty in distinguishing between different kinds of information to be conveyed, and how these should influence their decisions about word order? The findings from our study suggest that learners go through a stage of overgeneralising to inappropriate contexts one of the grammatical options available in Spanish, before eventually becoming native-like. The learners did not have information type problems, as has sometimes been suggested in the literature. The investigation of Spanish vocabulary development has been undertaken through analysis of learner performance on an oral interview task, combining picture description and personal conversation. A similar task was used with learners of French recorded in a sister project (details at www.flloc.soton.ac.uk), and research is being undertaken in parallel on both datasets. So far, results have been published regarding vocabulary development from beginner to intermediate level (Year 9 and Year 13 learners). The results provide information of a type not previously available about language learners in the UK educational system. Learner development in the two languages is strikingly similar, with similar numbers of base words known at the two levels (though Spanish word knowledge was somewhat more diverse). In both languages, substantial gains were made from Year 9 to Year 13, in terms of the numbers of base words known, and also the range of inflections used. Use of part of speech tagging for this subset of the data allowed further analysis of the word classes used at different levels. The Year 9 speakers productions in both languages are noticeably noun-heavy, with verbs used proportionally much more by Year 13 speakers. Indicators of more complex language use, such as interrogative and relative pronouns and adverbs, were also more frequent in the Year 13 data. These findings have clear theoretical value (for our understanding of the relationship between vocabulary and grammar development, as well as of vocabulary development itself). They also have clear implications for curriculum design and for effective classroom pedagogy (e.g. the need to focus on development of verb knowledge). The corpus is being promoted and findings are being disseminated through a series of conference presentations in the UK, Europe and North America. A successful end of project seminar was also organized in Southampton in January 2008, and attracted researchers from the UK, Spain, Portugal and the USA with whom ongoing networking is planned. A successor project begins in August 2008 and will allow further promotion of the corpus as well as continuation and extension of the substantive research programme.},

abstract = {This paper presents a wordnet for Slovene which was created semi-automaticallywith a combination of approaches and multilingual resources,in particular a bilingual dictionary, a parallel corpus and Wikipedia. Analysis of the results shows that the dictionary approach yields agood core wordnet but requires substantial manual editing due to a lack of automatic word-sense disambiguation. This was successfully improved with the corpus approach which, however, was limited to single-word literals. The last approach, based on Wikipedia, was only used for domain-specific monosemous terms, and can deal with multi-word literals and therefore usefully complements the previous two approaches. The created sloWNet was then used to semantically annotate a corpus for Slovene: one hundred high frequency nouns were annotated in a corpus of 100,000 words. The paper reports on the method and results of this manual annotation. Both the Slovene wordnet and annotated corpus are to be publicly available.},

abstract = {One of the best-known hypotheses of translation studies, the Explicitation Hypothesis, postulates that explicitation is “inherent” in the process of translation and may therefore be regarded as a “universal of translation”. In recent years, a number of corpus-based studies on explicitation have been produced, most of which purport to offer evidence in favor of this hypothesis. As a consequence, the alleged universality of explicitation has achieved the status of dogma in translation studies. The aim of the present article is to show that the dogma of translation-inherent explicitation rests on fallacious theoretical considerations and premature interpretations of empirical data. In the first place, it will be argued that the Explicitation Hypothesis strictly speaking does not even qualify as a scientific hypothesis, since it is unmotivated, unparsimonious and vaguely formulated. In the second place, it will be shown that previous studies on explicitation fail to provide conclusive evidence for the translation-inherent nature of explicitation due to a number of methodological shortcomings.

abstract = {There is mounting evidence that language users are sensitive to distributional information at many grain-sizes. Much of this research has focused on the distributional properties of words, the units they consist of (morphemes, phonemes), and the syntactic structures they appear in (verb-categorization frames, syntactic constructions). In a series of studies we show that comprehenders are also sensitive to the frequencies of compositional four-word phrases (e.g. don't have to worry): more frequent phrases are processed faster. The effect is not reducible to the frequency of the individual words or substrings and is observed across the entire frequency range (for low, mid and high frequency phrases). Comprehenders seem to learn and store frequency information about multi-word phrases. These findings call for processing models that can capture and predict phrase-frequency effects and support accounts where linguistic knowledge consists of patterns of varying sizes and levels of abstraction. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

annote = {This article offers interesting evidence suggesting that binning frequency is wrong, and that frequency is best treated as a continuous variable. Furthermore frequency effects are shown not only at higher frequency, but throughout the spectrum, from low to high frequency.

This article deals with multi-word expressions and made me think of a couple research questions:

1) Lexical diversity, frequency scores and frequency effects
Underlines how 'frequency' as a score is a function of the lexical diversity of a corpus. Arnon {\&} Snider do not discuss how their results might differ if the lexical diversity of the corpus was lower -- note, that they do use the Switchboard {\&} Fisher corpus (which is lower in lexical diversity) but they select 4 grams, which be their nature will be more diverse that the unigram frequencies of the corpus. Even then, a more lexically diverse sample (written) would produce even more diverse 4 grams (I suppose)

2) Sub-syntactic (chunks). 
I started thinking about the possibility of linking my satiation studies thinking about multi-word frequency measures as a way to see how predictable some sub-structures are and to what degree the whole syntactic meaning could be predicted based on this sub-structural information.},

abstract = {Reaction times (rts) are an important source of information in experimental psychology. Classical methodological considerations pertaining to the sta- tistical analysis of rt data are optimized for analyses of aggregated data, based on subject or item means (c.f., Forster {\&} Dickinson, 1976). Mixed- effects modeling (see, e.g., Baayen, Davidson, {\&} Bates, 2008) does not re- quire prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. Mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. In this study, we argue for empirical flexibility with respect to the choice of transforma- tion for the rts. We advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. We also show how trial-to-trial, longitudinal depen- dencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. These strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure. Special attention is paid to the evaluation of in- teractions involving fixed-effect factors that partition the levels sampled by random-effect factors.},

The applications based upon parallel corpora are numerous and growing in number: multilingual lexicography and terminology, machine and human translation, cross-language information retrieval, language learning, etc. The book's chapters have been commissioned from major figures in the field of parallel corpus building and exploitation, with the aim of showing the state of the art in parallel text alignment and use ten to fifteen years after the first parallel-text alignment techniques were developed. Within the book, the following broad themes are addressed: (i) techniques for the alignment of parallel texts at various levels such as sentence, clause, and word; (ii) the use of parallel texts in fields as diverse as translation, lexicography, and information retrieval; (iii) available corpus resources and the evaluation of alignment methods. The book will be of interest to researchers and advanced students of computational linguistics, terminology, lexicography and translation, both in academia and industry.},

abstract = {Judgments about the grammaticalitylacceptability of sentences are the most widely used data source in the syntactic literature. Typically, syntacticians rely on their own judgments, or those of a small number of colleagues. Although a number of researchers have argued that this is problematic, there is little research which systematically compares professional linguists' intuitions with those of linguistically naive speakers. This article examines linguists' and nonlinguists' judgments about one particular structure: questions with long distance dependencies. Linguists' judgments are shown to diverge from those of nonlinguists. These differences could be due to theoretical commitments (the conviction that linguistic processes apply 'across the board', and hence all sentences with the same syntactic structure should be equally grammatical) or to differences in exposure (the constructed examples of this structure found in the syntactic literature are very unrepresentative of ordinary usage). Whichever of these explanations turns out to be correct, it is clear that linguists' judgments are not representative of the population as a whole, and hence syntacticians should not rely on their own intuitions when testing their theories.},
annote = {The upshot of this article is that linguists and non-linguists differ systematically in terms of their acceptability ratings of wh-questions, declaratives and a few classic wh-islands. For Wh-questions and declaratives, the difference lies in the degree of acceptability, linguists like wh-questions more than the declaratives (in this study--which are all prefixed with a conjunction).

abstract = {In social media communication, multilingual speakers often switch between languages, and, in such an environment, automatic language identification becomes both a necessary and challenging task. In this paper, we describe our work in progress on the problem of automatic language identification for the language of social media. We describe a new dataset that we are in the process of creating, which contains Facebook posts and comments that exhibit code mixing between Bengali, English and Hindi. We also present some preliminary word-level language identification experiments using this dataset. Different techniques are employed, including a simple unsupervised dictionary-based approach, supervised word-level classification with and without contextual clues, and sequence labelling using Conditional Random Fields. We find that the dictionary-based approach is surpassed by supervised classification and sequence labelling, and that it is important to take contextual clues into consideration.},

abstract = {This article presents the problem of diacritic restoration (or diacritization) in the context of spell-checking, with the focus on an ortho- graphically rich language such as Spanish. We argue that despite the large volume of work published on the topic of diacritization, currently available spell-checking tools have still not found a proper solution to the problem in those cases where both forms of a word are listed in the checker's dictionary. This is the case, for instance, when a word form exists with and without diacritics, such as continuo ‘continuous' and continu´ o ‘he/she/it continued', or when different diacritics make other word distinctions, as in contin´ We propose a very simple solution based on a word bigram model derived from correctly typed Spanish texts and evaluate the ability of this model to restore diacritics in artificial as well as real errors. The case of diacritics is only meant to be an example of the possible applications for this idea, yet we believe that the same method could be applied to other kinds of orthographic or even grammatical errors. Moreover, given that no explicit linguistic knowledge is required, the proposed model can be used with other languages provided that a large normative corpus is available.},

We investigate five tasks: af- fect recognition, word similarity, recognizing textual entailment, event temporal ordering, and word sense disambiguation. For all five, we show high agreement between Mechani- cal Turk non-expert annotations and existing gold standard labels provided by expert label- ers. For the task of affect recognition, we also show that using non-expert labels for training machine learning algorithms can be as effec- tive as using gold standard annotations from experts. We propose a technique for bias correction that significantly improves annota- tion quality on two tasks. We conclude that many large labeling tasks can be effectively designed and carried out in this method at a fraction of the usual expense.},

abstract = {We propose a new computational approach for tracking and detecting statistically significant linguistic shifts in the meaning and usage of words. Such linguistic shifts are especially prevalent on the Internet, where the rapid exchange of ideas can quickly change a word's meaning. Our meta-analysis approach constructs property time series of word usage, and then uses statistically sound change point detection algorithms to identify significant linguistic shifts. We consider and analyze three approaches of increasing complexity to generate such linguistic property time series, the culmination of which uses distributional characteristics inferred from word co-occurrences. Using recently proposed deep neural language models, we first train vector representations of words for each time period. Second, we warp the vector spaces into one unified coordinate system. Finally, we construct a distance-based distributional time series for each word to track its linguistic displacement over time. We demonstrate that our approach is scalable by tracking linguistic change across years of micro-blogging using Twitter, a decade of product reviews using a corpus of movie reviews from Amazon, and a century of written books using the Google Book Ngrams. Our analysis reveals interesting patterns of language usage change commensurate with each medium.},

abstract = {While spoken codeswitching (CS) among Latinos has received significant scholarly attention, few studies have examined written CS, specifically naturally-occurring CS in email. This study contributes to an under-studied area of Latino linguistic practices by reporting the results of a study of CS in the emails of five Spanish-English bilingual Latinos. Methods are employed that are not often used in discourse analysis of email texts, namely multi-dimensional scaling and tree diagrams, to explore the contextual parameters of written Spanish-English CS systematically. Consistent with the findings of other studies of CS in CMC, English use was most associated with professional or formal contacts, and use of Spanish, the participants' native language, was linked to intimacy, informality, and group identification. Switches to Spanish functioned to personalize otherwise transactional or work-related English-dominant emails. The article also discusses novel orthographic and linguistic forms specific to the CMC context.},
annote = {5-minute read:

This article aims to investigate the use of Spanish-English by bilingual latinos in email communication. Only 5 participants were consulted, but the methods are/ were novel --multi-dimensional scaling and tree diagram analysis. The tentative results appear to concur with other studies: English is used as the lingua franca between interlocuters, but bilinguals tended to initiate emails in Spanish with other bilinguals. Use of Spanish tends to correlate with the intimate and community identification, whereas English forms the backbone for most communication.},

@article{Ferraro2014,
abstract = {Collocations in the sense of idiosyncratic binary lexical co-occurrences are one of the biggest challenges for any language learner. Even advanced learners make collocation mistakes in that they literally translate collocation elements from their native tongue, create new words as collocation elements, choose a wrong subcategorization for one of the elements, etc. Therefore, automatic collocation error detection and correction is increasingly in demand. However, while state-of-the-art models predict, with a reasonable accuracy, whether a given co-occurrence is a valid collocation or not, only few of them manage to suggest appropriate corrections with an acceptable hit rate. Most often, a ranked list of correction options is offered from which the learner has then to choose. This is clearly unsatisfactory. Our proposal focuses on this critical part of the problem in the context of the acquisition of Spanish as second language. For collocation error detection, we use a frequency-based technique. To improve on collocation error correction, we discuss three different metrics with respect to their capability to select the most appropriate correction of miscollocations found in our learner corpus. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Political discourse very often relies on translation. Political DiscourseAnalysis (PDA), however, has not yet taken full account of the phenomenon of trans- lation. This paper argues that the disciplines of Translation Studies (TS) and PDA can benefit from closer cooperation. It starts by presenting examples of authentic translations of political texts, commenting on them from the point of view of TS. These examples concern political effects caused by specific translation solutions; the processes by which information is transferred via translation to another culture; and the structure and function of equally valid texts in their respective cultures. After a brief survey of the discipline of Translation Studies, the paper concludes with outlining scope for interdisci- plinary cooperation between PDA and TS. This is illustrated with reference to an awareness of product features,multilingual texts, process analysis, and the politics of translation.},

abstract = {Individual happiness is a fundamental societal metric. Normally measured through self-report, happiness has often been indirectly characterized and overshadowed by more readily quantifiable economic indicators such as gross domestic product. Here, we examine expressions made on the online, global microblog and social networking service Twitter, uncovering and explaining temporal variations in happiness and information levels over timescales ranging from hours to years. Our data set comprises over 46 billion words contained in nearly 4.6 billion expressions posted over a 33 month span by over 63 million unique users. In measuring happiness, we construct a tunable, real-time, remote-sensing, and non-invasive, text-based hedonometer. In building our metric, made available with this paper, we conducted a survey to obtain happiness evaluations of over 10,000 individual words, representing a tenfold size improvement over similar existing word sets. Rather than being ad hoc, our word list is chosen solely by frequency of usage, and we show how a highly robust and tunable metric can be constructed and defended.},

Because the current definition of lemma frequency does not seem to provide word recognition researchers with useful information (as illustrated by a comparison of the lemma frequencies and the word form frequencies from the Corpus of Contemporary American English), we have not provided a column with this variable.

abstract = {There is tremendous interest in mining the abundant user generated content on the web. Many analysis techniques are language dependent and rely on accurate language identification as a building block. Even though there is already research on language identification, it focused on very `clean' editorially managed corpora, on a limited number of languages, and on relatively large-sized documents. These are not the characteristics of the content to be found in say, Twitter or Facebook postings, which are short and riddled with vernacular. In this paper, we propose an automated, unsupervised, scalable solution based on publicly available data. To this end we thoroughly evaluate the use of Wikipedia to build language identifiers for a large number of languages (52) and a large corpus and conduct a large scale study of the best-known algorithms for automated language identification, quantifying how accuracy varies in correlation to document size, language (model) profile size and number of languages tested. Then, we show the value in using Wikipedia to train a language identifier directly applicable to Twitter. Finally, we augment the language models and customize them to Twitter by combining our Wikipedia models with location information from tweets. This method provides massive amount of automatically labeled data that act as a bootstrapping mechanism which we empirically show boosts the accuracy of the models. With this work we provide a guide and a publicly available tool to the mining community for language identification on web and social data.},

Predicting document lo- cation of origin based on text content on a geodesic grid is computationally attractive since many standard meth- ods for supervised document classification carry over unchanged to geolocation in the form of predicting a most probable grid cell for a document. However, the grid-based approach suffers from sparse data problems if one wants to improve classification accuracy by mov- ing to smaller cell sizes. In this paper we investigate an enhancement of common methods for determining the geographic point of origin of a text document by kernel density estimation. For geolocation of tweets we obtain a improvements upon non-kernel methods on datasets of U.S. and global Twitter content.},

Aspects of that experience, for instance, the frequency of use of certain constructions or particular instances of constructions, have an impact on representation that is evidenced in speaker knowledge of conventionalized phrases and in language variation and change. It is shown that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonolog- ical characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency in- stances under the pressure of newer formations. An exemplar model that accommodates both phonological and semantic representation is elaborated to describe the data considered.*},

@article{Huang2007,
abstract = {Automatic dialect classification has gained interest in the field of speech research because of its importance in characterizing speaker traits and knowledge estimation which could improve integrated speech technology (e.g., speech recognition, speaker recognition). This study addresses novel advances in unsupervised spontaneous dialect classification in English and Spanish. The problem considers the case where no transcripts are available for training and test data, and speakers are talking spontaneously. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used for unsupervised dialect classification in our study. Techniques which aim to deal with confused acoustic regions in the GMMs are proposed, where confused regions in the GMMs are identified through data driven methods. The first technique excludes confused regions by finding dialect dependence in the untranscribed audio by selecting the most discriminative Gaussian mixtures [mixture selection (MS)]. The second technique includes the confused regions in the model, but the confused regions are balanced over all classes. This technique is implemented by identifying discriminative frames and confused frames in the audio data [frame selection (FS)]. The new confused regions contribute to model representation but does not impact classification performance. The third technique is to reduce the confused regions in the original model. Minimum classification error (MCE) is applied to achieve this objective. All three techniques implement discriminative training for GMM-based classification. Both the first technique (MS-GMM, GMM trained with mixture selection) and the second technique (FS-GMM, GMM trained with frame selection) improve dialect classification performance. Further improvement is achieved after applying the third technique (MCE training) before the first or second techniques. The system is evaluated using British English dialects and Latin American Spanish dialects. Measurable improvement is achieved in both corpora. Fina-$\backslash$nlly, the system is compared with human listener performance, and shown to outperform human listeners in terms of classification accuracy.},

abstract = {This paper examines a number of communication strategies that are deployed by EFL learners when writing English. Students learning a foreign language do not, of course, have a complete repertory of vocabulary and grammar; therefore, when faced with the need for a word that they do not know, they will try to resolve any ambiguity by deploying various communication strategies. These strategies include using approximations of meaning or circumlocutions, or simply switching to their mother tongue. Most studies in this field have been in the form of episodic reference. This study, however, focuses on the types of communication strategy that are most frequently used by certain EFL learners in a given situation, and on why those strategies are preferred. This study offers an analysis of a task-based corpus that was created specifically for this purpose.},

A large majority of computational linguists have degrees in computer science and positions in computer science departments. It was founded as an offshoot of an engineering discipline (machine translation), and has been subsequently shaped by its place within artificial intelligence, and by a heavy influx of theory and method from speech recognition (another engineering discipline) and machine learning. But computation is a means to an end; the essential feature is data collection, analysis, and prediction on the large scale. I will call it data-intensive experimental linguistics.

abstract = {Language identification, as the task of determining the language a given text is written in, has progressed substantially in recent decades. However, three main issues remain still unresolved: (i) distinction of similar languages, (ii) detec-tion of multilingualism in a single document, and (iii) identifying the language of short texts. In this paper, we describe our work on the development of a benchmark to encourage further research in these three directions, set forth an evaluation frame-work suitable for the task, and make a dataset of annotated tweets publicly available for research purposes. We also describe the shared task we organized to validate and assess the evaluation framework and dataset with systems submitted by seven differ-ent participants, and analyze the performance of these systems. The evaluation of the results submitted by the participants of the shared task helped us shed some light on the shortcomings of state-of-the-art language identification systems, and gives insight into the extent to which the brevity, multilingualism, and language similarity found in texts exacerbate the performance of language identifiers. Our dataset with nearly 35,000 tweets and the evaluation framework provide researchers and practitioners with suitable resources to further study the aforementioned issues on language iden-tification within a common setting that enables to compare results with one another.},

abstract = {In the development of corpus linguistics, the creation of corpora has had a critical role in corpus-based studies. The majority of created corpora have been associated with English and native languages, while other languages and types of corpora have received relatively less attention. Because an increasing number of corpora have been constructed, and each corpus is constructed for a definite purpose, this study identifies the functions of corpora and combines the values of various types of corpora for auto-learning based on the existing corpora. Specifically, the following three corpora are adopted: (a) the Corpus of Spanish; (b) the Corpus of Taiwanese Learners of Spanish; and (c) the Parallel Corpus of Spanish, English, and Chinese. These corpora represent a type of native, learner, and parallel language, respectively. We apply these corpora as auxiliary resources to identify the advantages of applying various types of corpora in language learning from a learner's perspective. In the environment of auto-learning, 28 participants completed frequency questions related to semantic and lexical aspects. After analyzing the questionnaire data, we obtained the following findings: (a) the native corpus requires a more advanced level of Spanish proficiency to manage ampler and deeper context; (b) the learners' corpus facilitates the distinction between error and correction during the learning process; (c) the parallel corpus assists learners in connecting form and meaning; (d) learning is more efficient if the learner can capitalizes on specific functions provided by various corpora in the application order of parallel, learner and native corpora.},

@article{McDonald2001,
abstract = {Attempts to quantify lexical variation have produced a large number of theoretical and empirical constructs, such as Word Frequency, Concreteness, and Ambiguity, which have been claimed to predict between-word differences in lexical processing behavior. Models of word recognition that have been developed to account for the effects of these variables have typically lacked adequate semantic representations, and have dealt with words as if they exist in isolation from their environment. We present a new dimension of lexical variation that is addressed to this concern. Contextual Distinctiveness (CD), a corpus-derived summary measure of the frequency distribution of the contexts in which a word occurs, is naturally compatible with contextual theories of semantic representation and meaning. Experiment 1 demonstrates that CD is a significantly better predictor of lexical decision latencies than occurrence frequency, suggesting that CD is the more psychologically relevant variable. We additionally explore the relationship between CD and six subjectively-defined measures: Concreteness, Context Availability, Number of Contexts, Ambiguity, Age of Acquisition and Familiarity and find CD to be reliably related to Ambiguity only. We argue for the priority of immediate context in determining the representation and processing of language.},

This idea has important theo-retical implications for our understanding of the relationship between the lexis and the text and (ultimately) between the text and the discourse community/ the mind of the speaker. Although the approaches to date have offered different possibilities for constructing collocation networks, we argue that they have not yet successfully operationalized some of the desired features of such networks. In this study, we revisit the concept of collocation networks and introduce GraphColl, a new tool developed by the authors that builds collocation networks from user-defined corpora. In a case study using data from McEnery's (2006a) study of the Society for the Reformation of Manners Corpus (SRMC), we demonstrate that collocation networks provide important insights into meaning relationships in language.},

We used the same training cor- pus (and therefore the same tag-set) to train both taggers. We then applied the taggers to the same test corpus and compared their re- spective behavior and in particular their error rates. Both taggers perform similarly with an error rate of around 5{\%}. From the detailed er- ror analysis it can be seen that the rule-based tagger has more problems with unknown words than the statistical tagger. But the results are opposite for tokens that aremany-ways ambigu- ous. If the unknown words are fed into the tag- gers with the help of an external lexicon (such as the Gertwol system) the error rate of the rule- based tagger drops to 4.7{\%}, and the respective rate of the statistical taggers drops to around 3.7{\%}.

abstract = {Unsupervised discovery of synonymous phrases is useful in a variety of tasks ranging from text mining and search en- gines to semantic analysis and machine translation. This pa- per presents an unsupervised corpus-based conditional model: Near-Synonym System (NeSS) for finding phrasal synonyms and near synonyms that requires only a large monolingual corpus. The method is based on maximizing information-theoretic combinations of shared contexts and is parallelizable for large-scale processing. An evaluation framework with crowd-sourced judgments is proposed and results are compared with alternate methods, demonstrating considerably superior results to the literature and to thesau- rus look up for multi-word phrases. Moreover, the results show that the statistical scoring functions and overall scala- bility of the system are more important than language spe- cific NLP tools. The method is language-independent and practically useable due to accuracy and real-time perfor- mance via parallel decomposition.},

abstract = {Studies in SLA have debated the importance of context of learning in the process of developing linguistic skills in a second language (L2). The present paper examines whether study abroad, as it provides opportunities for authentic L2 context, facilitates the acquisition of Spanish phonology. The corpus of this investigation is composed of speech samples from 46 students of Spanish: 26 studying abroad in Spain and 20 in a regular classroom environment in the United States. The students read a paragraph with 60 target words including segments such as word-initial stops (i.e., [p t k]),(1) intervocalic fricatives (i.e., [beta partial derivative v), word-final laterals (i.e., [1]), and palatal nasals (i.e., [eta]). The findings reveal the following patterns for both regular classroom and study abroad students across time: (a) similar gain in the case of voiced initial stops and word-final laterals, (b) lack of gain in the case of intervocalic fricatives, and (c) high levels of accuracy in the case of the palatal nasal in the pretest. Concerning the external data, the following factor groups predicted phonological gain among all learners: years of formal language instruction, reported use of Spanish before the semester, reported use of Spanish outside the classroom during the semester (days), reported use of Spanish outside the classroom during the semester (hours), gender, entrance Oral Proficiency Interview, exit Oral Proficiency Interview, and level at which formal instruction began.},

abstract = {Word frequency is the most important variable in research on word processing and memory. Yet, the main criterion for selecting word frequency norms has been the availability of the measure, rather than its quality. As a result, much research is still based on the old Kučera and Francis frequency norms. By using the lexical decision times of recently published megastudies, we show how bad this measure is and what must be done to improve it. In particular, we investigated the size of the corpus, the language register on which the corpus is based, and the definition of the frequency measure. We observed that corpus size is of practical importance for small sizes (depending on the frequency of the word), but not for sizes above 16–30 million words. As for the language register, we found that frequencies based on television and film subtitles are better than frequencies based on written sources, certainly for the monosyllabic and bisyllabic words used in psycholinguistic research. Finally, we found that lemma frequencies are not superior to word form frequencies in English and that a measure of contextual diversity is better than a measure based on raw frequency of occurrence. Part of the superiority of the latter is due to the words that are frequently used as names. Assembling a new frequency norm on the basis of these considerations turned out to predict word processing times much better than did the existing norms (including Kučera {\&} Francis and Celex). The new SUBTL frequency norms from the SUBTLEXUS corpus are freely available for research purposes from http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/supplemental, as well as from the University of Ghent and Lexique Web sites.},

Letter repetitions are unique CMC cues in that they appear to be a written emulation of a spoken paralinguistic cue - phoneme extension. In this study we explore letter repetitions as a CMC cue, with specific emphasis on elucidating the link between them and spoken nonverbal cues. The letter repetitions are studied in the Enron Corpus, a large ecologically valid collection (???500,000) of e-mail messages sent by and to employees of the Enron Corporation. We conclude that letter repetitions in the corpus often, but not always, emulate spoken nonverbal cues. This conclusion is examined in a longitudinal analysis that demonstrates the dynamic nature of this cue, and suggests that the usage of letter repetitions is increasing over time, while the link to spoken language is diminishing. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to address an apparent gap in the literature concerning the study of code-switching in computer-mediated communication in English/Spanish. Using (small samples of) blogs, emails and social media (Facebook/ Twitter --specific user accounts), the author categorizes CS language into various categories. Of these categories, the one that is most-highly associated with all language sources (registers) is culturally-bound switches [isolated nouns, idiomatic expressions, discourse and identity markers].

This paper outlines a set of three steps to perform language identification for three similawr languages: croatian, bosnian, and slovenian. The three steps include using top 100 most frequent words, a second-order Markov Model trigram character model, and the use of a highly indicative (unique) words from each language.

Adding the steps together results increase to .99 recall and .99 precision.},

abstract = {This study investigates intergroup homogeneity within high intermediate and advanced L2 writers of English from Czech, Finnish, German, and Spanish first language backgrounds. A variety of linguistic features related to lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and cohesion were used to compare texts written by L1 speakers of English to L2 writers of English in order to examine if L2 writing shares text similarities regardless of the L1 of the writer. The results of the study provide evidence for intergroup homogeneity in the linguistic patterns of L2 writers in that four word-based indices (hypernymy, polysemy, lexical diversity, and stem overlap) demonstrated similar patterns of occurrence in the L2 writer populations sampled. However, significant differences were reported for these indices between L1 and L2 writers. The results of this study provide evidence that some aspects of L2 writing may not be cultural or independent, but rather based on the amount and type of linguistic knowledge available to L2 learners as a result of language experience and learner proficiency level. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Reaction times (rts) are an important source of information in experimental psychology. Classical methodological considerations pertaining to the sta- tistical analysis of rt data are optimized for analyses of aggregated data, based on subject or item means (c.f., Forster {\&} Dickinson, 1976). Mixed- effects modeling (see, e.g., Baayen, Davidson, {\&} Bates, 2008) does not re- quire prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. Mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. In this study, we argue for empirical flexibility with respect to the choice of transforma- tion for the rts. We advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. We also show how trial-to-trial, longitudinal depen- dencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. These strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure. Special attention is paid to the evaluation of in- teractions involving fixed-effect factors that partition the levels sampled by random-effect factors.},

abstract = {The importance of vocabulary in reading comprehension emphasizes the need to accurately assess an individual's familiarity with words. The present article highlights problems with using occurrence counts in corpora as an index of word familiarity, especially when studying individuals varying in reading experience. We demonstrate via computational simulations and norming studies that corpus-based word frequencies systematically overestimate strengths of word representations, especially in the low-frequency range and in smaller-size vocabularies. Experience-driven differences in word familiarity prove to be faithfully captured by the subjective frequency ratings collected from responders at different experience levels. When matched on those levels, this lexical measure explains more variance than corpus-based frequencies in eye-movement and lexical decision latencies to English words, attested in populations with varied reading experience and skill. Furthermore, the use of subjective frequencies removes the widely reported (corpus) Frequency × Skill interaction, showing that more skilled readers are equally faster in processing any word than the less skilled readers, not disproportionally faster in processing lower frequency words. This finding challenges the view that the more skilled an individual is in generic mechanisms of word processing, the less reliant he or she will be on the actual lexical characteristics of that word.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Word frequency is the most important variable in research on word processing and memory. Yet, the main criterion for selecting word frequency norms has been the availability of the measure, rather than its quality. As a result, much research is still based on the old Kučera and Francis frequency norms. By using the lexical decision times of recently published megastudies, we show how bad this measure is and what must be done to improve it. In particular, we investigated the size of the corpus, the language register on which the corpus is based, and the definition of the frequency measure. We observed that corpus size is of practical importance for small sizes (depending on the frequency of the word), but not for sizes above 16–30 million words. As for the language register, we found that frequencies based on television and film subtitles are better than frequencies based on written sources, certainly for the monosyllabic and bisyllabic words used in psycholinguistic research. Finally, we found that lemma frequencies are not superior to word form frequencies in English and that a measure of contextual diversity is better than a measure based on raw frequency of occurrence. Part of the superiority of the latter is due to the words that are frequently used as names. Assembling a new frequency norm on the basis of these considerations turned out to predict word processing times much better than did the existing norms (including Kučera {\&} Francis and Celex). The new SUBTL frequency norms from the SUBTLEXUS corpus are freely available for research purposes from http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/supplemental, as well as from the University of Ghent and Lexique Web sites.},

abstract = {Recently, proposals have been made to relate processing difficulties in aphasic language performance to limitations in resources for grammatical processing (Carpenter et al., 1994; Hagiwara, 1995; Kolk, 1995; Martin {\&} Romani, 1994). Such proposals may account for a defining characteristic of agrammatic sentence production: reduced syntactic complexity. Syntactic structures that require deep hierarchical processing or reversals of canonical word order make demands exceeding limited resources. In the present study, we investigate the possibility of counteracting hypothesized resource limitations by increasing the availability of relatively complex sentences (i.e., datives and passives). The phenomenon of "syntactic priming" has been observed in a number of studies with healthy adults (e.g., Bock, 1986). With respect to Broca's aphasia, we hypothesized that increased availability of a syntactic structure, due to syntactic priming, results in a lesser demand on (limited) resources for sentence production. We elicited speech from 12 Broca's aphasics and 12 control subjects in three different conditions: spontaneous speech, picture description without priming, and picture description with priming. In addition, we varied instructions, in order to determine the role of strategies. The main findings were that (a) Brocas show stronger syntactic priming effects than controls; (b) the effects are automatic rather than strategic; and (c) in conditions with priming, Brocas produce relatively complex sentences (e.g., passives). We discuss these results in relation to capacity theories.},

In this study, we present a subtitle-based word frequency list for Spanish, one of the most widely spoken languages. The subtitle frequencies are based on a corpus of 41M words taken from contemporary movies and TV series (screened between 1990 and 2009). In addition, the frequencies have been validated by correlating them with the RTs from two megastudies involving 2,764 words each (lexical decision and word naming tasks). The subtitle frequencies explained 6{\%} more of the variance than the existing written frequencies in lexical decision, and 2{\%} extra in word naming.},

In all cases, our framework obtains results that are comparable or superior to the state of the art.},

abstract = {Cohen and Dehaene et al. proposed that the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) in the left midfusiform gyrus, contrary to its name, is limited to the extraction of an abstract letter string and not involved in proper visual word recognition. We examined this prelexical function of the VWFA by a parametric block design with five levels of written word frequency. The lowest level was represented by pseudowords and the highest level by words of very high frequency. Contrary to the assumed prelexical function of the VWFA, increasing frequency was associated with decreasing brain activation in a large posterior cluster of the left hemisphere including middle and posterior fusiform regions. The same negative relation between frequency and activation was found in several left frontal clusters. The relation of increasing frequency and decreasing activation in occipitotemporal regions corresponds to a similar relation in the same brain regions found by studies which experimentally manipulated object or face familiarity. This convergence suggests that fusiform regions are specialized for extracting and storing abstract patterns when processing visual objects and these patterns serve as recognition units in subsequent encounters with the same objects. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The book covers all necessary knowledge for using R, from its installation in your computer to the organization and development of scripts. For every chapter, the book presents practical and replicable examples of R code, providing context and facilitating the learning process. Based on the material, the reader will learn how to download financial data from local files or the Internet, represent and process it using native objects in R, and create tables and figures to report the results in a technical document. The book is organized based on the author's practical experience in scientific research and includes instructions for using the best R packages for each purpose, such as xtable and texreg for reporting tables, dplyr in data processing, and ggplot2 in creating figures. After showing the capabilities of R in processing financial data, the last chapter presents three complete and reproducible examples of research in Finance. This book is recommended for researchers and students interested in learning how to use R. No prior knowledge of programming or finance is required to take advantage of this book. After finishing, the reader will have enough knowledge to develop their own scripts autonomously, producing academic documents or data analysis for public and private institutions.},

abstract = {Twitter provides access to large volumes of data in real time, but is notoriously noisy, hampering its utility for NLP. In this paper, we target out-of-vocabulary words in short text messages and propose a method for identifying and normalising ill-formed words. Our method uses a classifier to detect ill-formed words, and generates correction candidates based on morphophonemic similarity. Both word similarity and context are then exploited to select the most probable correction candidate for the word. The proposed method doesnt require any annotations, and achieves state-of-the-art performance over an SMS corpus and a novel dataset based on Twitter.},

My particular work focuses on codeswitching, the alternating use of two languages in the discourse of bilingual individuals. More specifically, I considered how attitudes towards codeswitching affect the type of codeswitches produced in both oral and written narratives. We would expect those subjects who have positive attitudes towards codeswitching to codeswitch more and in a more complex mode than those who have negative attitudes. The findings are quite surprising, indicating a shift in attitudes towards codeswitching among the new generations of college-educated Spanish-English bilingual individuals.},

annote = {In this article the authors layout a set of attributes and characteristics that are minimally required to define a corpus. The broad areas include the type of corpus, the range of language varieties, the time period, and whether to include writing and or speech in the corpus.

The authors comment on the importance of achieving a balanced corpus. However they also point out the pragmatic limitations in actually achieving balance in corpora. Their approach is to suggest that a corpus should be evaluated for its strengths and weaknesses and then modified to reflect this in order to approximate balanced and representative corpora. 

A very important point me in this article is that traditional statistical methods for sampling or not adequate for language corpora. The points include the fact that it is very difficult to delimit the total population of the corpus, there's no obvious unit of language which is to be sampled in a corpus, and finally the sheer size of the population causes problems.

Another key aspect in this article includes a discussion on the importance of reception that is the language that people here and read and production that is the language that people speak and write. Those texts that are easier to come by have a wide reception. Yet, it is important to make an effort to include as much production material as possible. 

In describing the population the authors make a distinction between internal criteria, those which are essentially linguistic and external criteria, those which are essentially non-linguistic.

They also comment on issues dealing with Johndra and topic and the difficulty in distinguishing between Johndra and topic. They suggest that topics and/or genres are better described through a network then buy some type of hierarchy.},

abstract = {Reports 3 experiments with a total of 59 undergraduates and graduate students which support the hypothesis that in a lexical decision task, prefixed words are analyzed into their constituent morphemes before lexical access occurs. Results show that nonwords that are stems of prefixed words (e.g., juvenate) take longer to classify than nonwords which are not stems (e.g., pertoire), suggesting that the nonword stem is directly represented in the lexicon. Further, words which can occur both as a free and as a bound morpheme (e.g., vent) take longer to classify when the bound form is more frequent than the free form. Finally, prefixed nonwords took longer to classify when they contained a real stem (e.g., dejuvenate), compared with control items which did not (e.g., depertoire). A general model of word recognition is presented which incorporates the process of morphological decomposition. (17 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA},

Poole covers vectors and vector geometry first to enable students to visualize the mathematics while they are doing matrix operations. With a concrete understanding of vector geometry, students are able to visualize and understand the meaning of the calculations that they will encounter. By seeing the mathematics and understanding the underlying geometry, students develop mathematical maturity and can think abstractly when they reach vector spaces. Throughout the text, Poole's direct conversational writing style connects with students, and an abundant selection of applications from a broad range of disciplines clearly demonstrates the relevance of linear algebra.},

Because the current definition of lemma frequency does not seem to provide word recognition researchers with useful information (as illustrated by a comparison of the lemma frequencies and the word form frequencies from the Corpus of Contemporary American English), we have not provided a column with this variable. Instead, we hope that the full list of PoS frequencies will help researchers to collectively determine which combination of frequencies is the most informative.},

It starts by presenting examples of authentic translations of political texts, commenting on them from the point of view of TS. These examples concern political effects caused by specific translation solutions; the processes by which information is transferred via translation to another culture; and the structure and function of equally valid texts in their respective cultures. After a brief survey of the discipline of Translation Studies, the paper concludes with outlining scope for interdisci- plinary cooperation between PDA and TS. This is illustrated with reference to an awareness of product features,multilingual texts, process analysis, and the politics of translation.},

Ss were Wisc Coll freshmen {\&} sophomores. One hundred sentences were divided into eight groups, each dealing with a particular type of syntactic variation. Sentences were presented in pairs {\&} Ss were asked to rate each sentence on a five-point acceptability or frequency scale. An intra-S consistency index was devised: Ss were generally consistent on both kinds of judgments between lexically different but syntactically identical sentences if a one-position difference on the five-place scale is allowed. The same measure of consistency was arrived at in comparing frequency vs acceptability judgments. An analysis of variance showed the reliability of the group to be quite high: results support the hypothesis that active sentences are judged to be both more frequent {\&} more acceptable than passive sentences. Sentences with might both positive {\&} negative were judged to be somewhat more frequent than sentences with may, although acceptability was the same for both types. The simple past was shown to be more readily interchangeable with the present perfect when the reference was to a series of actions rather than to a state that existed continuously during the previous period. The subjunctive was felt to be more frequent {\&} more acceptable than either the indicative or should after Vs expressing both demands {\&} persuasion.

abstract = {The induction problems facing language learners have played a central role in debates about the types of learning biases that exist in the human brain. Many linguists have argued that some of the learning biases necessary to solve these language induction problems must be both innate and language-specific (i.e., the Universal Grammar (UG) hypothesis). Though there have been several recent high-profile investigations of the necessary learning bias types for different linguistic phenomena, the UG hypothesis is still the dominant assumption for a large segment of linguists due to the lack of studies addressing central phenomena in generative linguistics. To address this, we focus on how to learn constraints on long-distance dependencies, also known as syntactic island constraints. We use formal acceptability judgment data to identify the target state of learning for syntactic island constraints and conduct a corpus analysis of child-directed data to affirm that there does appear to be an induction problem when learning these constraints. We then create a computational learning model that implements a learning strategy capable of successfully learning the pattern of acceptability judgments observed in formal experiments, based on realistic input. Importantly, this model does not explicitly encode syntactic constraints. We discuss learning biases required by this model in detail as they highlight the potential problems posed by syntactic island effects for any theory of syntactic acquisition. We find that, although the proposed learning strategy requires fewer complex and domain-specific components than previous theories of syntactic island learning, it still raises difficult questions about how the specific biases required by syntactic islands arise in the learner. We discuss the consequences of these results for theories of acquisition and theories of syntax. (Contains 5 tables, 6 figures, and 14 footnotes.)},
annote = {Use of a parsed corpus (CHILDES) of child-directed speech to explore the exposure to wh-movement types. Corpus searches reveal that wh-movment types studied are rare. Even some 'grammatical' structures do not return in the corpus used.

This study underscores the problem of corpus size and availability of parsed corpus resources. The target patterns occur in the tail of the distribution, and statistics are unreliable here. 

I also question the mixing of adult behavior as the target with adult speech directed to children. I would assume there is an age gradient effect: the complexity of communication is tightly related to the wh-movement phenomenon studied here. It seems implausible that this level of complexity is typical when adults address children.},

A multidimensional (factor) analysis of a corpus of L2 Spanish writing (202,241 words) generated by second- and third-year, university-level learners was performed. The analysis uncovered four significant clusters that can be considered distinct discourse types with two main stylistic variations: narrative (characterized by verbal features) and expository (characterized by nominal features). Results also provide examples of the multiple ways that stylistic sophistication and linguistic complexity occur in the L2. Although the Spanish learners discourse did not show signs of syntactic complexity (e.g. frequent use of relative clauses, subordinate clauses, use of clitics), the frequent use of nominal features affects informational density due to the presence of numerous derivational morphemes. Inflectional complexity in the form of marked forms was not predominant in the data set. Still, the learners verbal inflections did vary, which is a sign of L2 development (Howard 2002, 2006; Collentine 2004; Marsden and David 2008).},

Based on data from the International Corpus of English annotated for variables describing the matrix verb and the complement, we run two random forests analyses to determine where the Asian English have developed complementation preferences different from the two native speaker varieties. We find not only a variety of differences between the Asian and the native Englishes, but also that the Asian Englishes are more similar (i.e. ‘better predicted by') the American English data. Further, as the first study of its kind to extend the MuPDAR approach from the now frequent regression analy- ses to random forests analysis, this study adds a potentially useful analytical tool to the oſten messy and skewed observational data corpus linguists need to deal with.},

abstract = {Studies of word production in patients with Alzheimer's disease have identified the age of acquisition of words as an important predictor of retention or loss, with early acquired words remaining accessible for longer than later acquired words. If, as proposed by current theories, effects of age of acquisition reflect the involvement of semantic representations in task performance, then some aspects of word recognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease should also be better for early than later acquired words. We employed a version of the lexical decision task which we term the lexical selection task. This required participants to indicate which of four items on a page was a real word (the three 'foils' being orthographically plausible nonwords). Twenty-two patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were compared with an equal number of matched controls. The controls made few errors on the test, demonstrating that the controls were cognitively intact, and that the words were familiar to participants of their age and level of education. The Alzheimer patients were impaired overall, and recognized fewer late than early acquired words correctly. Performance of the Alzheimer patients on the lexical selection task correlated significantly with their scores on the mini mental state examination. Word recognition becomes impaired as Alzheimer's disease progresses, at which point effects of age of acquisition can be observed on the accuracy of performance.},

abstract = {The current studies used a syntactic priming paradigm with 3- and 4-year-old children. In Experiment 1, children were asked to describe a series of drawings depicting transitive and dative relations to establish baseline production levels. In Experiment 2, an experimenter described a similar series of drawings using one of two syntactic forms (i.e., active/passive for transitive; double-object/prepositional for dative). Children were then asked to describe pictures identical to those shown in the corresponding baseline procedure. In both transitive and dative conditions, 4-year-old children were more likely to use a particular syntactic form if it had been used by the experimenter. Three-year-old children did not show priming effects, but their production of transitive sentences was higher following transitive primes than in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, an additional group of 3-year-olds participated in a procedure in which they repeated the experimenter's sentences before describing the pictures. This procedure yielded significant priming effects for transitive and dative forms. These results indicate that very young children possess abstract syntactic representations, but that their access to these representations is sensitive to task demands.},

It analyzes the discourse functions of interrogative allo-repetitions in a corpus of oral Mexican Spanish from the perspective of both their conversational role as repair mechanisms and as linguistic strategies to convey politeness or impoliteness in interaction. The main findings of this research are that interrogative allo-repetitions fulfill different politeness (i.e. face-saving, face-flattering, or face-threatening) strategies depending not only on their conversational function (true vs. fictitious repair mechanisms), but also and most importantly on the type of verbal interaction and cultural settings in which they take place, as well as the relationship between participants.},

abstract = {One of the best-known hypotheses of translation studies, the Explicitation Hypothesis, postulates that explicitation is “inherent” in the process of translation and may therefore be regarded as a “universal of translation”. In recent years, a number of corpus-based studies on explicitation have been produced, most of which purport to offer evidence in favor of this hypothesis. As a consequence, the alleged universality of explicitation has achieved the status of dogma in translation studies. The aim of the present article is to show that the dogma of translation-inherent explicitation rests on fallacious theoretical considerations and premature interpretations of empirical data. In the first place, it will be argued that the Explicitation Hypothesis strictly speaking does not even qualify as a scientific hypothesis, since it is unmotivated, unparsimonious and vaguely formulated. In the second place, it will be shown that previous studies on explicitation fail to provide conclusive evidence for the translation-inherent nature of explicitation due to a number of methodological shortcomings.

abstract = {There is tremendous interest in mining the abundant user generated content on the web. Many analysis techniques are language dependent and rely on accurate language identification as a building block. Even though there is already research on language identification, it focused on very `clean' editorially managed corpora, on a limited number of languages, and on relatively large-sized documents. These are not the characteristics of the content to be found in say, Twitter or Facebook postings, which are short and riddled with vernacular. In this paper, we propose an automated, unsupervised, scalable solution based on publicly available data. To this end we thoroughly evaluate the use of Wikipedia to build language identifiers for a large number of languages (52) and a large corpus and conduct a large scale study of the best-known algorithms for automated language identification, quantifying how accuracy varies in correlation to document size, language (model) profile size and number of languages tested. Then, we show the value in using Wikipedia to train a language identifier directly applicable to Twitter. Finally, we augment the language models and customize them to Twitter by combining our Wikipedia models with location information from tweets. This method provides massive amount of automatically labeled data that act as a bootstrapping mechanism which we empirically show boosts the accuracy of the models. With this work we provide a guide and a publicly available tool to the mining community for language identification on web and social data.},

Pinker's prescriptions combine data from ballots given to the Usage Panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, the usage notes of several dictionaries and style guides, the historical analyses in Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, the meta-analysis in Roy Copperud's American Usage and Style: The Consensus, and views from modern linguistics represented in The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language and the blog Language Log.},

In this article, we describe the creation of a novel Arabic resource with dialect annotations. We have created a large monolingual data set rich in dialectal Arabic content called the Arabic On-line Commentary Data set (Zaidan and Callison-Burch 2011). We describe our annotation effort to identify the dialect level (and dialect itself) in each of more than 100,000 sentences from the data set by crowdsourcing the annotation task, and delve into interesting annotator behaviors (like over-identification of one's own dialect). Using this new annotated data set, we consider the task of Arabic dialect identification: Given the word sequence forming an Arabic sentence, determine the variety of Arabic in which it is written. We use the data to train and evaluate automatic classifiers for dialect identification, and establish that classifiers using dialectal data significantly and dramatically outperform baselines that use MSA-only data, achieving near-human classification accuracy. Finally, we apply our classifiers to discover dialectical data from a large Web crawl consisting of 3.5 million pages mined from on-line Arabic newspapers.},

This pa- per presents an unsupervised corpus-based conditional model: Near-Synonym System (NeSS) for finding phrasal synonyms and near synonyms that requires only a large monolingual corpus. The method is based on maximizing information-theoretic combinations of shared contexts and is parallelizable for large-scale processing. An evaluation framework with crowd-sourced judgments is proposed and results are compared with alternate methods, demonstrating considerably superior results to the literature and to thesau- rus look up for multi-word phrases. Moreover, the results show that the statistical scoring functions and overall scala- bility of the system are more important than language spe- cific NLP tools. The method is language-independent and practically useable due to accuracy and real-time perfor- mance via parallel decomposition.},

Students learning a foreign language do not, of course, have a complete repertory of vocabulary and grammar; therefore, when faced with the need for a word that they do not know, they will try to resolve any ambiguity by deploying various communication strategies. These strategies include using approximations of meaning or circumlocutions, or simply switching to their mother tongue. Most studies in this field have been in the form of episodic reference. This study, however, focuses on the types of communication strategy that are most frequently used by certain EFL learners in a given situation, and on why those strategies are preferred. This study offers an analysis of a task-based corpus that was created specifically for this purpose.},

By minimizing part of the response selection process in the experimental task, the impact of response decision time on the obtained lexical decision time is probably reduced relative to the standard yes/no LDT (Gordon, 1983). Experiments 1 and 2 show that the go/no-go LDT is sensitive to the effects of word frequency and associative priming--the magnitude of these effects is similar with the two tasks. More important, the go/no-go LDT has a number of advantages with respect to the "standard" yes/no LDT: It offers faster response times, more accurate responding, and fewer processing demands than does the yes/no task. Accordingly, the go/no-go task appears to be an excellent alternative to the standard yes/no task.},

abstract = {The method of postulates (that is, assumptions or axioms) and defini-tionst is fully adequate to mathematics; as for other sciences, the more complex their subject-matter, the less amenable are they to this method, since, under it, every descriptive or historical fact becomes the subject of a new postulate. Nevertheless, the postulational method can further the study of language, because it forces us to state explicitly whatever we assume, to define our terms, and to decide what things may exist independently and what things are interdependent.2 Certain errors can be avoided or corrected by examining and formu-lating our (at present tacit) assumptions and defining our (often unde-fined) terms.3 Also, the postulational method saves discussion, because it limits our statements to a defined terminology; in particular, it cuts us off from psychological dispute.4 Discussion of the fundamentals of our science 1 For a clear exposition of this method, see J. W. Young, Lectures on the Fundamental Concepts of Algebra and Geometry, New York 1911. 1 Cf. A. P. Weiss's set of postulates for psychology, Psychological Review. 32. 83. 3 Examples are many. Bopp took for granted that the formative elements of Indo-European were once independent words; this is a needless and unwarranted assumption. The last descendant of his error is the assumption that IE compound words are historically derived from phrases (Jacobi, Compositum und Nebensatz, Bonn 1897; this even in Brug-mann, Grundrisz I)I, 1, pp. 37. 78; cf. TAPA 45. 73 ff.). The notion is gaining ground that some forms have less meaning than others and are therefore more subject to phonetic change (Horn, Sprachkiirper und Sprachfunktion, Palaestra 135, Berlin 1921); I, for one, can discover no workable definition of the terms 'meaning' and 'phonetic change' under which this notion can be upheld. The whole dispute, perhaps today as unstilled as fifty years ago, about the regularity of phonetic change, is at bottom a question of terminology. *Recall the difficulties and obscurities in the writings of Humboldt and Steinthal, and the psychological dispute of Paul, Wundt, Delbrueck. From our point of view, the last-named was wrong in denying the value of descriptive data, but right in saying that it is indifferent what system of psychology a linguist believes in (Grundfragen der Sprach-forschung, Strassburg 1901). The trouble over the nature of the sentence is largely non-linguistic; contrast the simplicity and usefulness of Meillet's definition (adopted below), 153},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Languages and genes are both transmitted from generation to generation, with opportunity for differential reproduction and survivorship of forms. Here we apply a rigorous inference framework, drawn from population genetics, to distinguish between two broad mechanisms of language change: drift and selection. Drift is change that results from stochasticity in transmission and it may occur in the absence of any intrinsic difference between linguistic forms; whereas selection is truly an evolutionary force arising from intrinsic differences -- for example, when one form is preferred by members of the population. Using large corpora of parsed texts spanning the 12th century to the 21st century, we analyze three examples of grammatical changes in English: the regularization of past-tense verbs, the rise of the periphrastic `do', and syntactic variation in verbal negation. We show that we can reject stochastic drift in favor of a selective force driving some of these language changes, but not others. The strength of drift depends on a word's frequency, and so drift provides an alternative explanation for why some words are more prone to change than others. Our results suggest an important role for stochasticity in language change, and they provide a null model against which selective theories of language evolution must be compared.},

This paper is a study of linguistic diversity on websites maintained for and by members of diaspora groups in Germany. Based on online ethnography and an interpretive approach to code-switching, the paper explores the relationships between language choices and the complex architecture of these websites, which offer edited content as well as spaces for user interaction. Language choice in edited sections, patterns of code-switching in discussion forums, and language choice for user screen names and message signatures are examined. The findings demonstrate how code choices are tailored to the requirements of different modes within a website, and how various codes are creatively employed to display and negotiate identities that are related to the diaspora and its virtual discursive spaces.},

The unprecedented scale of this data enables the application of quantitative methods to automatically discover the lexical variables that distinguish the language of geographical areas such as cities. This can be paired with the segmentation of geographical space into dialect regions, within the context of a single joint statistical model — thus simultaneously identifying coherent dialect regions and the words that distinguish them. Finally, a diachronic analysis reveals rapid changes in the geographical distribution of these lexical features, suggesting that statistical analysis of social media may offer new insights on the diffusion of lexical change.},

abstract = {Corpus-based Translation Studies focuses on translation as a product by comparing comparable corpora of translated and non-translated texts. A number of distinctive features of translations have been posited including, for example, explicitation, simplification, normalisation, levelling out, source language interference, and under-representation of target language unique items. Nevertheless, research of this area has until recently been confined largely to translational English and closely related European languages. If the features of translational language that have been reported on the basis of these languages are to be generalised as 'translation universals', the language pairs involved must not be restricted to English and closely related European languages. Clearly, evidence from a genetically distant language pair such as English and Chinese is arguably more convincing, if not indispensable. This article explores, in the broad context of translation universal research, lexical and grammatical properties of translational Chinese on the basis of two one-million-word balanced comparable corpora of translated and non-translated native Chinese texts. The findings of this empirical study of the properties of translational Chinese have enabled a reevaluation, from the perspective of translational Chinese, of largely English-based translation universal hypotheses.

abstract = {This project had two main aims: to create a small scale, high quality database of spoken learner Spanish, as a new resource for the study of second language acquisition, and to undertake a short programme of substantive research, using the new database. Spoken Spanish data have been collected from classroom learners in schools and universities in England, using a series of specially designed elicitation tasks, including storytelling, picture description, discussion and individual interview. There were 20 learners at each of 3 levels: beginners (Year 9 students aged 13-14), intermediate students (A2 students aged 17-18), and fourth year undergraduates. All of them were native English speakers. Depending on their level, each learner was audiorecorded undertaking between 3 and 5 oral tasks. They also completed computer based and paper based tasks which provided complementary data on aspects of their Spanish knowledge. For comparison purposes, small numbers of native speakers were also recorded undertaking the same tasks. The resulting database contains 290 digital soundfiles (240 learner recordings, 50 native speaker recordings). These are accompanied by transcripts in CHILDES (Child Language Data Exchange System) format, which can be analysed with linguistic analysis software (CLAN). Some files have an extra layer of tagging which identifies parts of speech. A project website has been created and the material has been made freely available in anonymised form through the website, for use by other second language acquisition researchers. The website can be viewed at www.splloc.soton.ac.uk. The substantive research programme undertaken so far has investigated the acquisition of two central features of Spanish grammar which differ from English, i.e. word order in sentences (more fixed in English, more variable in Spanish), and the pronoun system (Spanish object pronouns are marked for gender, and generally precede the verb). The third substantive issue investigated to date is the development of Spanish vocabulary. The investigation of learners developing control of Spanish pronouns has been based on two tasks (picture based production task, and computer based interpretation task). The performance of learners at all three levels has been compared on this issue. The results show that beginner and intermediate learners tend to avoid the use of pronouns, preferring to use full noun phrases in their place. However, once they start to use pronouns, learners usage tends to be accurate, and the advanced learners achieve high levels of accuracy (75 per cent in the production task, 90 per cent in the interpretation task). These findings are important for second language acquisition theory, because they are relevant to a central debate regarding the source(s) of learner errors, and the extent to which learners can ever develop a native speaker like grammar system. The findings support the view that learners can and do acquire a correct underlying representation of Spanish grammar, and early errors in their performance are due to other problems such as processing limitations or communicative pressures. The investigation of learners developing control of Spanish word order is relevant to another central discussion in SLA theory. Spanish word order is variable, with subjects both preceding and following verbs, in varying circumstances. The different possibilities are controlled by two interacting factors: a) the grammar associated with particular types of verb, and b) the kind of information being conveyed (broad or narrow focus). Different explanations have been advanced previously for the difficulties learners encounter with this system. Does the problem lie in the underlying grammar system, or do the learners have difficulty in distinguishing between different kinds of information to be conveyed, and how these should influence their decisions about word order? The findings from our study suggest that learners go through a stage of overgeneralising to inappropriate contexts one of the grammatical options available in Spanish, before eventually becoming native-like. The learners did not have information type problems, as has sometimes been suggested in the literature. The investigation of Spanish vocabulary development has been undertaken through analysis of learner performance on an oral interview task, combining picture description and personal conversation. A similar task was used with learners of French recorded in a sister project (details at www.flloc.soton.ac.uk), and research is being undertaken in parallel on both datasets. So far, results have been published regarding vocabulary development from beginner to intermediate level (Year 9 and Year 13 learners). The results provide information of a type not previously available about language learners in the UK educational system. Learner development in the two languages is strikingly similar, with similar numbers of base words known at the two levels (though Spanish word knowledge was somewhat more diverse). In both languages, substantial gains were made from Year 9 to Year 13, in terms of the numbers of base words known, and also the range of inflections used. Use of part of speech tagging for this subset of the data allowed further analysis of the word classes used at different levels. The Year 9 speakers productions in both languages are noticeably noun-heavy, with verbs used proportionally much more by Year 13 speakers. Indicators of more complex language use, such as interrogative and relative pronouns and adverbs, were also more frequent in the Year 13 data. These findings have clear theoretical value (for our understanding of the relationship between vocabulary and grammar development, as well as of vocabulary development itself). They also have clear implications for curriculum design and for effective classroom pedagogy (e.g. the need to focus on development of verb knowledge). The corpus is being promoted and findings are being disseminated through a series of conference presentations in the UK, Europe and North America. A successful end of project seminar was also organized in Southampton in January 2008, and attracted researchers from the UK, Spain, Portugal and the USA with whom ongoing networking is planned. A successor project begins in August 2008 and will allow further promotion of the corpus as well as continuation and extension of the substantive research programme.},

Three groups of 18-year-old native speakers of English were tested on comprehension and recall of English Complex NP constructions. Two groups were 'low academic ability' (LAA) students and one group were 'high academic ability' (HAA) students. Pre-test HAA levels of recall and comprehension were much higher than those of the LAA groups. One LAA group underwent training to improve sentence recall and then carried out a post-test involving recall and comprehension. Levels of recall, but not comprehension, rose to HAA levels. The second LAA group underwent training to improve comprehension and then carried out a post-test involving recall and compre-hension. Levels of both recall and comprehension rose to HAA levels. Contrary to the working memory hypothesis, the results support the view that variations in adult native speaker performance arise from variations in procedural grammatical compe-tence. Some implications of this conclusion for the teaching of first-language grammar during the school years are outlined.},

Although ON reliably predicts behavioral variability in many lexical tasks, its utility is inherently limited by its relatively restrictive definition. In the present article, we introduce a new measure of orthographic similarity generated using a standard computer science metric of string similarity (Levenshtein distance). Unlike ON, the new measure-named orthographic Levenshtein distance 20 (OLD20)-incorporates comparisons between all pairs of words in the lexicon, including words of different lengths. We demonstrate that OLD20 provides significant advantages over ON in predicting both lexical decision and pronunciation performance in three large data sets. Moreover, OLD20 interacts more strongly with word frequency and shows stronger effects of neighborhood frequency than does ON. The discussion section focuses on the implications of these results for models of visual word recognition.},

abstract = {In the development of corpus linguistics, the creation of corpora has had a critical role in corpus-based studies. The majority of created corpora have been associated with English and native languages, while other languages and types of corpora have received relatively less attention. Because an increasing number of corpora have been constructed, and each corpus is constructed for a definite purpose, this study identifies the functions of corpora and combines the values of various types of corpora for auto-learning based on the existing corpora. Specifically, the following three corpora are adopted: (a) the Corpus of Spanish; (b) the Corpus of Taiwanese Learners of Spanish; and (c) the Parallel Corpus of Spanish, English, and Chinese. These corpora represent a type of native, learner, and parallel language, respectively. We apply these corpora as auxiliary resources to identify the advantages of applying various types of corpora in language learning from a learner's perspective. In the environment of auto-learning, 28 participants completed frequency questions related to semantic and lexical aspects. After analyzing the questionnaire data, we obtained the following findings: (a) the native corpus requires a more advanced level of Spanish proficiency to manage ampler and deeper context; (b) the learners' corpus facilitates the distinction between error and correction during the learning process; (c) the parallel corpus assists learners in connecting form and meaning; (d) learning is more efficient if the learner can capitalizes on specific functions provided by various corpora in the application order of parallel, learner and native corpora.},

abstract = {Syntactic satiation is the phenomenon where some sentences that initially seem ungrammatical appear more acceptable after repeated exposures (Snyder, 2000). We investigated satiation by manipulating two factors known to affect syntactic priming, a phenomenon where recent exposure to a grammatical structure facilitates subsequent processing of that structure (Bock, 1986). Specifically, we manipulated (i) Proximity of exposure (number of sentences between primes and targets) and (ii) Lexical repetition (type of phrase repeated across primes and targets). Experiment 1 investigated whether acceptability ratings of Complex-NP Constraint (CNPC) and Subject islands improve as consequence of these variables. If so, priming and satiation may be linked. When primes were separated from targets by one sentence, CNPC islands' acceptability was improved by a preceding island of the same type, but Subject islands' acceptability was not. When prime-target pairs were separated by five sentences, we found no improvement for either island type. Experiment 2 asked whether improvements in Experiment 1 reflected online processing or offline end-of-sentence effects. We used a self-paced reading paradigm to diagnose online structure-building and processing facilitation (Ivanova et al., 2012a) during processing. We found priming for Subject islands when primes and targets were close together, but not when they were further apart. No effects were detected when CNPC islands were close together, but there was a localized effect when sentences were further apart. The disjunction between Experiments 1 and 2 suggests repetition of the structure in Subject islands facilitated online processing but did not 'spill over' to acceptability ratings. Meanwhile, results for CNPC islands suggest that acceptability rating improvements in Experiment 1 may be driven by factors distinct from online processing facilitation. Together, our experiments show that satiation may not be a one-size-fit-all phenomenon but, instead, appears to manifest itself differently for different types of structures. Priming is possible and may be linked to satiation in some purportedly " unbuildable " structures (e.g., Subject islands), but not for all types (e.g., CNPC islands). Despite this, it appears that while the types of mechanisms targeting different island types are distinct, they are nevertheless similarly sensitive to the proximity between individual exposures.},

abstract = {The present study examines the effects of code-switching (CS) attitudes in Acceptability Judgment Tasks (AJTs) among early Spanish/English bilinguals in the United States. In doing so, we explore whether negative attitudes towards CS result in lower/degraded ratings, and, likewise, whether positive attitudes result in higher acceptability ratings. Fifty Spanish/English bilinguals completed a survey that comprised a linguistic background questionnaire and a set of monolingual and code-switched sentences featuring two sets of stimuli, pro-drop (Sande, 2015) and pronouns (Koronkiewicz, 2014), that they rated on a 1–7 Likert scale; additionally, the survey included a final component that gathered information about the speakers' attitudes towards CS. The pro-drop and pronouns code-switched stimuli gave rise to a total of four conditions. Results from a Linear Mixed Model revealed that all participants, regardless of attitude, distinguished between all Conditions. Furthermore, an effect for attitude was found for two of the conditions, such that the more positive the attitude, the higher the rating given on the AJT. In fact, these two conditions were composed of the CS structures that were rated higher by participants in Sande (2015) and Koronkiewicz (2014). No effect for attitude was found for CS structures that were rated low in the original studies. Thus, this investigation suggests that the attitudes that bilingual speakers have towards CS play a role in the ratings that they provide in AJTs, but in a manner that highlights, rather than obscures, the rule-governed nature of CS.},
annote = {Main point:

The authors found a relationship between attitudes towards code-switching and acceptability ratings. Athough the speakers where able to distinguish between acceptability as a reflection of grammaticality, there was an overall effect of attitude towards code-switching --lowering scores for those with negative attitudes. 

This study underscores a particular issue with acceptability judgments, perscriptive attitudes are confounded with ratings. Labov has made this point. The fact that acceptability tasks often administered via writing the effect may be associated with attitudes about register as well.},

abstract = {The rapid advancement in the theoretical understanding of statistical and machine learning methods for semisupervised learning has made it difficult for nonspecialists to keep up to date in the field. Providing a broad, accessible treatment of the theory as well as linguistic applications, Semisupervised Learning for Computational Linguistics offers self-contained coverage of semisupervised methods that includes background material on supervised and unsupervised learning. The book presents a brief history of semisupervised learning and its place in the spectrum of learning methods before moving on to discuss well-known natural language processing methods, such as self-training and co-training. It then centers on machine learning techniques, including the boundary-oriented methods of perceptrons, boosting, support vector machines (SVMs), and the null-category noise model. In addition, the book covers clustering, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, related generative methods, and agreement methods. It concludes with the graph-based method of label propagation as well as a detailed discussion of spectral methods. Taking an intuitive approach to the material, this lucid book facilitates the application of semisupervised learning methods to natural language processing and provides the framework and motivation for a more systematic study of machine learning.},

We note that grounded practical help on feature selection for the mostly unsupervised context in which social scientists work is scant: instead, advice is lifted from the supervised literature with little thought as to whether it is opti-mal, or even appropriate, for the tasks at hand. Worryingly, as we show with real data, substantive inferences and model performance for unsupervised approaches are not generally robust to perturbations of common preprocessing steps. We introduce a statistical procedure and easy-to-use software—preText—allowing scholars to examine the sensitivity of their findings under alternate preprocessing regimes. For a range of datasets, we show that while some steps are mostly harmless, researchers should be cautious about others, since they transform the data in ways likely to lead the unwary down different " forking paths " of inference.},

@article{Meyer2005,
abstract = {In an article in a recent issue of Language (Newmeyer 2003), Frederick Newmeyer argues for a clear separation between what he terms 'knowledge of language [i.e. grammar] and use of language [i.e. pragmatics]' (682). In developing his argument, N makes frequent reference to linguistic analyses that are corpus-based, that is, centered on information taken from large datasets of actual speech or writing (e.g. transcriptions of conversations, newspaper articles, novels). In N's view, grammar is distinct from pragmatics, and because a corpus contains examples of actual language use drawn from a large community of speakers and writers, it can yield only performance data. As a result, N argues, 'there is no way that one can draw conclusions about the grammar of an individual from usage facts about communities, particularly communities from which the individual receives no speech input' (696). Implicit in this argument, however, is the view that the traditional way of collecting linguistic data—introspection—somehow gives us insights into the competence of the native speaker that corpus data cannot. The real issue, we argue, is not which kind of data gets us closer to the native speaker's competence, a goal that we believe is largely unobtainable, but rather how linguists can best collect data relevant to the linguistic analyses they are conducting. There is considerable evidence that a corpus can enrich our understanding of language and, in many cases, provide linguists with examples they would have never considered had they relied only on data obtained through introspection. To support this view, it is worth reviewing N's critique of Manning's (2003) use of corpus data to challenge Pollard and Sag's (1994) analysis of verb subcategorization in English. Manning (2003:299) notes that Pollard and Sag claim that the verb regard can be followed by as-complements (1) but not by predicative to-complements (2). (1) We regard Kim as an acceptable candidate. (2) *We regard Kim to be an acceptable candidate. However, in an analysis of texts in the New York Times, Manning (2003:300) found examples such as 3, where regard can take a to-complement. (3) Conservatives argue that the Bible regards homosexuality to be a sin. Manning notes that counterexamples such as 3 were not anomalous: he found many additional discrepancies between Pollard and Sag's intuitions and the data appearing in his corpus. In commenting on Manning's observations, N states: Perhaps [example 2] is generated by Pollard's grammar and perhaps it is not. Perhaps [example 2] is},

The present study investigated a special type of word combination, lexical bundles, defined as a sequence of three or more words that co-occur frequently in a particular register [Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English, Longman, London, 1999]. The goal was to improve the understanding of the function of lexical bundles in academic prose by comparing the use of such bundles by published authors in history and biology and by stu- dents at three different levels in those disciplines. The first part of this study focused on a corpus of published writing from history and biology journals. The most frequent four-word lexical bundles in that corpus (called target bundles) were identified and classified structurally and functionally. The second part concentrated on students? use of those target bundles. The findings of this study indicated that students rarely used these target bundles in their writing. In addition, when students did use certain bundles, their use did not correspond to the uses of bundles employed by professional authors. Finally, some pedagogical implications of the findings, as well as suggested paths for future research, are introduced and discussed.},

abstract = {Many syntactic phenomena have received competing accounts, either in terms of formal grammatical mechanisms, or in terms of independently motivated properties of language processing mechanisms (‘‘reductionist'' accounts). A variety of different types of argument have been put forward in efforts to distinguish these competing accounts. This article critically examines a number of arguments that have been offered as evidence in favour of formal or reductionist analyses, and concludes that some types of argument are more decisive than others. It argues that evidence from graded acceptability effects and from isomorphism between acceptability judgements and on-line compre- hension profiles are less decisive. In contrast, clearer conclusions can be drawn from cases of overgeneration, where there is a discrepancy between accept- ability judgements and the representations that are briefly constructed on-line, and from tests involving individual differences in cognitive capacity. Based on these arguments, the article concludes that a formal grammatical account is better supported in some domains, and that a reductionist account fares better in other domains. Phenomena discussed include island constraints, agreement attraction, constraints on anaphora, and comparatives.},

A variety of arguments are put forth to justify this rejection, most importantly, that corpora are necessarily “finite and somewhat accidental” while the set of grammatical utterances is “presumably infinite” (Chomsky 1957: 15), and that, therefore, “probabilistic considerations have nothing to do with grammar” (Chomsky 1964[1962]: 215, n. 1; cf. also Chomsky 1957: 17). Chomsky is frequently reported as backing up this claim with the observation thatthe sentence I live in New York is fundamentally more likely than I live in Dayton, Ohio purely by virtue of the fact that there are more people likely to say the former than the latter (McEnery and Wilson 2001: 10).As always, it is difficult to decide whether Chomsky seriously offers this example in support of his position. Not that it really matters: Chomsky's contempt for and his ignorance of quantitative issues is of no concern to modern corpus linguistics. Chomsky's irredeemably anti-empirical views are firmly rooted in his anti-empiricist philosophy, and no amount of quantitatively sophisticated corpus-based argumentation will ever change his mind.},

In media studies the term "context collapse" describes the process by which online social networks bring together people from various social contexts, thereby creating a diverse networked audience. In online social networks that involve participants from different countries and language communities, language choice becomes a pertinent issue. This paper draws on empirical data from social networks among young multilingual people on Facebook to examine strategies of language choice and negotiation. Drawing on the sociolinguistic framework of audience design, the sociolinguistics of multilingualism and computer-mediated discourse analysis, the analysis examines language choice in initiating and responding contributions, metapragmatic negotiations of language style and the role of English as a resource among networked writers.},

abstract = {Automatic dialect classification has gained interest in the field of speech research because of its importance in characterizing speaker traits and knowledge estimation which could improve integrated speech technology (e.g., speech recognition, speaker recognition). This study addresses novel advances in unsupervised spontaneous dialect classification in English and Spanish. The problem considers the case where no transcripts are available for training and test data, and speakers are talking spontaneously. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used for unsupervised dialect classification in our study. Techniques which aim to deal with confused acoustic regions in the GMMs are proposed, where confused regions in the GMMs are identified through data driven methods. The first technique excludes confused regions by finding dialect dependence in the untranscribed audio by selecting the most discriminative Gaussian mixtures [mixture selection (MS)]. The second technique includes the confused regions in the model, but the confused regions are balanced over all classes. This technique is implemented by identifying discriminative frames and confused frames in the audio data [frame selection (FS)]. The new confused regions contribute to model representation but does not impact classification performance. The third technique is to reduce the confused regions in the original model. Minimum classification error (MCE) is applied to achieve this objective. All three techniques implement discriminative training for GMM-based classification. Both the first technique (MS-GMM, GMM trained with mixture selection) and the second technique (FS-GMM, GMM trained with frame selection) improve dialect classification performance. Further improvement is achieved after applying the third technique (MCE training) before the first or second techniques. The system is evaluated using British English dialects and Latin American Spanish dialects. Measurable improvement is achieved in both corpora. Fina-$\backslash$nlly, the system is compared with human listener performance, and shown to outperform human listeners in terms of classification accuracy.},

abstract = {This study investigates intergroup homogeneity within high intermediate and advanced L2 writers of English from Czech, Finnish, German, and Spanish first language backgrounds. A variety of linguistic features related to lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and cohesion were used to compare texts written by L1 speakers of English to L2 writers of English in order to examine if L2 writing shares text similarities regardless of the L1 of the writer. The results of the study provide evidence for intergroup homogeneity in the linguistic patterns of L2 writers in that four word-based indices (hypernymy, polysemy, lexical diversity, and stem overlap) demonstrated similar patterns of occurrence in the L2 writer populations sampled. However, significant differences were reported for these indices between L1 and L2 writers. The results of this study provide evidence that some aspects of L2 writing may not be cultural or independent, but rather based on the amount and type of linguistic knowledge available to L2 learners as a result of language experience and learner proficiency level. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Seventy one non-college-bound 16-24 year-old speakers of English completed a battery of 18 verbal and cognitive skill assessments, and read a series of sentences as their eye movements were monitored. Statistical analyses were performed to establish what tests of reading abilities were predictive of eye-movement patterns across this population and how strong the effects were. We found that individual scores in rapid automatized naming and word identification tests (i) were the only participant variables with reliable predictivity throughout the time-course of reading; (ii) elicited effects that superceded in magnitude the effects of established predictors like word length or frequency; and (iii) strongly modulated the influence of word length and frequency on fixation times. We discuss implications of our findings for testing reading ability, as well as for research of eye-movements in reading.},

abstract = {This paper reports findings of a case study of the networked language practices of two young users of the social networking site Facebook. Theoretically informed by sociolinguistics and computer-mediated discourse analysis, this paper contributes to the study of language and participation in social media by developing an empirical approach to sharing and by focusing on the relation between sharing practices and linguistic repertoires. The paper proposes an understanding of sharing as an interactional practice of entextualizing significant moments for a networked audience. Data collection and analysis follow a mixed-methods approach. The primary data consists of the participants' public Facebook timelines during a period of one year. It is complemented by qualitative interviews and systematic observation of the their digital literacy practices on Facebook. The analysis distinguishes three stages of sharing - selecting, styling, and negotiating - and then moves on to individual case studies, which illustrate how the two participants mobilise linguistic resources in order to share moments of transnational mobility with their audience. The findings show how subtle shifts in the selection, combination and negotiation of linguistic resources index participants' transnational trajectories and their orientation to particular subsets of their audience, and how the audience takes an active role in negotiating the modes and meanings of sharing in social networking.},

abstract = {Ever since first mobile phones equipped with GPS came to the market, knowing the exact user location has become a holy grail of almost every service that lives in the digital world. Starting with the idea of location based services, nowadays it is not only important to know where users are in real time, but also to be able predict where they will be in future. Moreover, it is not enough to know user location in form of latitude longitude coordinates provided by GPS devices, but also to give a place its meaning (i.e., semantically label it), in particular detecting the most probable home location for the given user. The aim of this paper is to provide novel insights on differences among the ways how different types of human digital trails represent the actual mobility patterns and therefore the differences between the approaches interpreting those trails for inferring said patterns. Namely, with the emergence of different digital sources that provide information about user mobility, it is of vital importance to fully understand that not all of them capture exactly the same picture. With that being said, in this paper we start from an example showing how human mobility patterns described by means of radius of gyration are different for Flickr social network and dataset of bank card transactions. Rather than capturing human movements closer to their homes, Flickr more often reveals people travel mode. Consequently, home location inferring methods used in both cases cannot be the same. We consider several methods for home location definition known from the literature and demonstrate that although for bank card transactions they provide highly consistent results, home location definition detection methods applied to Flickr dataset happen to be way more sensitive to the method selected, stressing the paramount importance of adjusting the method to the specific dataset being used.},

abstract = {In the last 40 years, research on models of spoken and written language has been split between two seemingly irreconcilable traditions: formal linguistics in the Chomsky tradition, and information theory in the Shannon tradition. Zellig Harris had advocated a close alliance between grammatical and information-theoretic principles in the analysis of natural language, and early formal-language theory provided another strong link between information theory and linguistics. Nevertheless, in most research on language and computation, grammatical and information-theoretic approaches had moved far apart. Today, after many years on the defensive, the information-theoretic approach has gained new strength and achieved practical successes in speech recognition, information retrieval, and, increasingly, in language analysis and machine translation. The exponential increase in the speed and storage capacity of computers is the proximate cause of these engineering successes, allowing the automatic estimation of the parameters of probabilistic models of language by counting occurrences of linguistic events in very large bodies of text and speech. However, I will argue that information-theoretic and computational ideas are also playing an increasing role in the scientific understanding of language, and will help bring together formal-linguistic and information-theoretic perspectives.},

A large majority of computational linguists have degrees in computer science and positions in computer science departments. It was founded as an offshoot of an engineering discipline (machine translation), and has been subsequently shaped by its place within artificial intelligence, and by a heavy influx of theory and method from speech recognition (another engineering discipline) and machine learning. But computation is a means to an end; the essential feature is data collection, analysis, and prediction on the large scale. I will call it data-intensive experimental linguistics. I wish to explain how data-intensive linguistics differs from mainstream practice, why I consider it to be genuine linguistics, and why I believe that it enables fundamental advances in our understanding of language.},

abstract = {This dissertation investigates a variety of problems in psycholinguistics and computational linguistics caused by the differences in verb subcategorization probabilities found between various corpora and experimental data sets. For psycholinguistics, these problems include the practical problem of which frequencies to use for norming psychological experiments, as well as the more theoretical issue of which frequencies are represented in the mental lexicon and how those frequencies are learned. In computational linguistics, these problems include the decreases in the accuracy of probabilistic applications such as parsers when they are used on corpora other than the one on which they were trained. Evidence is presented showing that different senses of verbs and their corresponding differences in subcategorization, as well as inherent differences between the production of sentences in psychological norming protocols and language use in context, are important causes of the subcategorization frequency differences found between corpora. This suggests that verb subcategorization probabilities should be based on individual senses of verbs rather than the whole verb lexeme, and that “test tube” sentences are not the same as “wild” sentences. Hence, the influences of experimental design on verb subcategorization probabilities should be given careful consideration. This dissertation will demonstrate a model of how the relationship between verb sense and verb subcategorization can be employed. This dissertation will demonstrate a model of how the relationship between verb sense and verb subcategorization can be employed to predict verb subcategorization based on the semantic context preceding the verb in corpus data. The predictions made by the model are shown to be the same as predictions made by human subjects given the same contexts.},

Recently, there has been a surge of interest within the computational linguistics (CL) community in the social dimension of language. In this article we present a survey of the emerging field of ”computa- tional sociolinguistics" that reflects this increased interest. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of CL research on sociolinguistic themes, featuring topics such as the relation between language and social identity, language use in social interaction, and multilingual communi- cation. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for synergy between the research communities involved, by showing how the large-scale data-driven methods that are widely used in CL can complement existing sociolinguistic studies, and how sociolinguistics can inform and challenge the methods and assumptions used in CL studies. We hope to convey the possible benefits of a closer collaboration between the two communities and conclude with a discussion of open challenges.},

Interestingly, we find that the influence of the metaphorical framing effect is covert: people do not recognize metaphors as influential in their decisions; instead they point to more ‘‘substantive'' (often numerical) information as the motivation for their problem-solving decision. Metaphors in language appear to instantiate frame-consistent knowledge structures and invite structurally consistent inferences. Far from being mere rhetorical flourishes, metaphors have profound influences on how we conceptualize and act with respect to important societal issues. We find that exposure to even a single metaphor can induce substantial differences in opinion about how to solve social problems: differences that are larger, for example, than pre-existing differences in opinion between Democrats and Republicans.},

abstract = {In a multilingual society, language not only reflects culture and her- itage, but also has implications for social status and the degree of integration in society. Different languages can be a barrier between monolingual communities, and the dynamics of language choice could explain the prosperity or demise of local languages in an in- ternational setting. We study this interplay of language and net- work structure in diverse, multi-lingual societies, using Twitter. In our analysis, we are particularly interested in the role of bilinguals. Concretely, we attempt to quantify the degree to which users are the “bridge-builders” between monolingual language groups, while monolingual users cluster together. Also, with the revalidation of English as a lingua franca on Twitter, we reveal users of the native non-English language have higher influence than English users, and the language convergence pattern is consistent across the regions. Furthermore, we explore for which topics these users prefer their native language rather than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest sociolinguistic study in a network setting.},

However, categorical data can introduce unique issues in data wrangling, particularly in real-world settings with collaborators and periodically-updated dynamic data. This paper discusses common problems arising from categorical variable transformations in R, demonstrates the use of factors, and suggests approaches to address data wrangling challenges. For each problem, we present at least two strategies for management, one in base R and the other from the ‘tidyverse.' We consider several motivating examples, suggest defensive coding strategies, and outline principles for data wrangling to help ensure data quality and sound analysis.},

Semi-sentences and degree of grammaticalness: two approaches

- assign levels for the 'distance' from an appropriate non-deviant sentence
- collect acceptability ratings from participants

Marks rejects the first approach as it is inherently non-psychological; language is rooted in psychological operations. However, he points out that acceptability ratings do not only reflect the formal aspects of language. 

Marks shows that sentences with anomaly early will be judged less acceptable (3b) than those that contain anomaly later (3c). In both cases one one deviation is apparent, so the acceptability process is contingent on the psychological left-to-right parsing process.

abstract = {Language change is a complex social phenomenon, revealing pathways of communication and sociocultural influence. But, while language change has long been a topic of study in sociolinguistics, traditional linguistic research methods rely on circumstantial evidence, estimating the direction of change from differences between older and younger speakers. In this paper, we use a data set of several million Twitter users to track language changes in progress. First, we show that language change can be viewed as a form of social influence: we observe complex contagion for phonetic spellings and "netspeak" abbreviations (e.g., lol), but not for older dialect markers from spoken language. Next, we test whether specific types of social network connections are more influential than others, using a parametric Hawkes process model. We find that tie strength plays an important role: densely embedded social ties are significantly better conduits of linguistic influence. Geographic locality appears to play a more limited role: we find relatively little evidence to support the hypothesis that individuals are more influenced by geographically local social ties, even in their usage of geographical dialect markers.},

We used the same training cor- pus (and therefore the same tag-set) to train both taggers. We then applied the taggers to the same test corpus and compared their re- spective behavior and in particular their error rates. Both taggers perform similarly with an error rate of around 5{\%}. From the detailed er- ror analysis it can be seen that the rule-based tagger has more problems with unknown words than the statistical tagger. But the results are opposite for tokens that aremany-ways ambigu- ous. If the unknown words are fed into the tag- gers with the help of an external lexicon (such as the Gertwol system) the error rate of the rule- based tagger drops to 4.7{\%}, and the respective rate of the statistical taggers drops to around 3.7{\%}. Combining the taggers by using the out- put of one tagger to help the other did not lead to any further improvement.},

We show that our approach is able to learn production patterns from noisy training data and that it works for a wide range of language pairs. It even works across different alphabets, e.g. we obtain good results on the tested language pairs English-Russian, English-Greek, and English-Farsi. Our method performs sig-nificantly better than similarity measures used in previous work on cognates.},

Key to this analysis is the use of the computational tool Coh-Metrix, which measures cohesion and text difficulty at various levels of language, discourse, and conceptual analysis, and a statistical method known as discriminant function analysis. Results show that L1 and L2 written texts vary in several dimensions related to the writer's use of lexical choices. These dimensions correlate to lexical depth of knowledge, variation, and sophistication. These findings, together with the relevance of the new computational tools for the text analysis used in the study, are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, in contrast to Dutch and Hebrew, it is not the complete morphological family of a complex Finnish word that codetermines response latencies but only the subset of words directly derived from the complex word itself. Comparisons with parallel experiments using translation equivalents in Dutch and Hebrew showed substantial cross-language predictivity of family size between Finnish and Dutch but not between Finnish and Hebrew, reflecting the different ways in which the Hebrew and Finnish morphological systems contribute to the semantic organization of concepts in the mental lexicon.},

abstract = {Large scale analysis and statistics of socio-technical systems that just a few short years ago would have required the use of consistent economic and human resources can nowadays be conveniently performed by mining the enormous amount of digital data produced by human activities. Although a characterization of several aspects of our societies is emerging from the data revolution, a number of questions concerning the reliability and the biases inherent to the big data "proxies" of social life are still open. Here, we survey worldwide linguistic indicators and trends through the analysis of a large-scale dataset of microblogging posts. We show that available data allow for the study of language geography at scales ranging from country-level aggregation to specific city neighborhoods. The high resolution and coverage of the data allows us to investigate different indicators such as the linguistic homogeneity of different countries, the touristic seasonal patterns within countries and the geographical distribution of different languages in multilingual regions. This work highlights the potential of geolocalized studies of open data sources to improve current analysis and develop indicators for major social phenomena in specific communities.},

abstract = {The movements of ideas and content between locations and languages are unquestionably crucial concerns to researchers of the information age, and Twitter has emerged as a central, global platform on which hundreds of millions of people share knowledge and information. A variety of research has attempted to harvest locational and linguistic metadata from tweets in order to understand important questions related to the 300 million tweets that flow through the platform each day. However, much of this work is carried out with only limited understandings of how best to work with the spatial and linguistic contexts in which the information was produced. Furthermore, standard, well-accepted practices have yet to emerge. As such, this paper studies the reliability of key methods used to determine language and location of content in Twitter. It compares three automated language identification packages to Twitter's user interface language setting and to a human coding of languages in order to identify common sources of disagreement. The paper also demonstrates that in many cases user-entered profile locations differ from the physical locations users are actually tweeting from. As such, these open-ended, user-generated, profile locations cannot be used as useful proxies for the physical locations from which information is published to Twitter.},

Nevertheless, students are not used to describing their own line of reasoning and usually do not know how to lay the foundations for their arguments in an organised fashion. Establishing commentary with certain methodological guidelines that give students the skills to ground strategies in an organised way has helped to considerably improve students ability to rationalise their own translation process. In this paper, an explanation will be given of these guidelines, which reflect both macro- and micro-strategies and help to establish a coherent basis for the translation process. Subsequently, a commentary, made by a student about her translation into Spanish of a scientific text written in German, will be presented. The aim will be to describe the interrelation of the guidelines with the students rationale.},

We investigate five tasks: af- fect recognition, word similarity, recognizing textual entailment, event temporal ordering, and word sense disambiguation. For all five, we show high agreement between Mechani- cal Turk non-expert annotations and existing gold standard labels provided by expert label- ers. For the task of affect recognition, we also show that using non-expert labels for training machine learning algorithms can be as effec- tive as using gold standard annotations from experts. We propose a technique for bias correction that significantly improves annota- tion quality on two tasks. We conclude that many large labeling tasks can be effectively designed and carried out in this method at a fraction of the usual expense.},

In the current paper we respond to some arguments that have been given in support of continuing to use the traditional nonquantitative method in syntax/semantics research. One recent defence of the traditional method comes from Phillips (2009), who argues that no harm has come from the nonquantitative approach},

Section 2: empirical investigations

Two ways to gather data in any scientific domain:
- naturalistic observation (corpus studies included here)
* Advocates: Bresnan 2007, Bresnan {\&} Nikitina 2009, Labov 1975, 1996)
- controlled experiments (experimental syntax, behavioral methods here)

Section 3: arguments in favor of non-quantitative methods

1. Difficultly of gathering quantitative data
2. Viability of small number of participants in other domains
3. Quantitative evidence is also inconclusive, so why bother?
4. Quantitative evidence is insufficient and slows progress
5. Linguists make better participants (avoid non-relevant factors)
- Cognitive bias: confirmation bias (researcher and/or participant)
6. Public forums perform the vetting process
7. No harm has come from non-quantitative approaches

Section 4: faulty judgments in the literature

- Dative alternation/ extraction (Bresnan {\&} Nikitina, 2009)
- Syntactic flexibility of idioms
- Heavy NP shift

However, it is not yet clear whether the behavioral effects reported for monosyllabic words generalize reliably to multisyllabic words. Hierarchical regression techniques were used to examine the effects of standard variables (phonological onsets, stress pattern, length, orthographic N, phonological N, word frequency) and additional variables (number of syllables, feedfor- ward and feedback phonological consistency, novel orthographic and phonological similar- ity measures, semantics) on the pronunciation and lexical decision latencies of 6115 monomorphemic multisyllabic words. These predictors accounted for 61.2{\%} and 61.6{\%} of the variance in pronunciation and lexical decision latencies, respectively, higher than the estimates reported by previous monosyllabic studies. The ﬁndings we report represent a well-speciﬁed set of benchmark phenomena for constraining nascent multisyllabic models of English word recognition.},

abstract = {Within the communicative foreign language classroom, which is the currently favored approach to teaching Spanish at the university level, little attention is given to L2 Spanish pronunciation instruction. It is generally viewed as unimportant and something that L2 learners will acquire on their own with enough quality input from native speakers. This is apparent in Arteaga's (2000) review of ten first-year Spanish textbooks, which finds that only four attempt to teach pronunciation. Some recent researchers such as Elliott (1995a, 1995b, 1997), González-Bueno (1997) and Morin (2007) have recommended that L2 Spanish learners receive explicit pronunciation instruction to improve the acquisition of target sounds. Zampini (1994), for example, recommends explicit instruction of two Spanish allophones of /d/, which are very difficult for native English speaking Spanish learners to acquire. She postulates that their difficulty is due to interference of the English phonemes that correspond to the Spanish occlusive and approximant realizations of /d/. The present study extends Zampini's work by focusing on explicit pronunciation instruction of intervocalic /d/ to first-year Spanish learners, a population not attested in the literature, and compares the results of oral reading of a level-appropriate text before and after instruction to results obtained from control group students who perform the same reading task, but instead of explicit pronunciation instruction, they receive input from a native Spanish speaker.},

abstract = {Multilingual posts can potentially affect the outcomes of content analysis on microblog platforms. To this end, language identification can provide a monolingual set of content for analysis. We find the unedited and idiomatic language of microblogs to be challenging for state-of-the-art language identification methods. To account for this, we identify five microblog characteristics that can help in language identification: the language profile of the blogger (blogger), the content of an attached hyperlink (link), the language profile of other users mentioned (mention) in the post, the language profile of a tag (tag), and the language of the original post (conversation), if the post we examine is a reply. Further, we present methods that combine these priors in a post-dependent and post-independent way. We present test results on 1,000 posts from five languages (Dutch, English, French, German, and Spanish), which show that our priors improve accuracy by 5 {\%} over a domain specific baseline, and show that post-dependent combination of the priors achieves the best performance. When suitable training data does not exist, our methods still outperform a domain unspecific baseline. We conclude with an examination of the language distribution of a million tweets, along with temporal analysis, the usage of twitter features across languages, and a correlation study between classifications made and geo-location and language metadata fields.},

It is designed for use by researchers in psycholinguistics, particularly those concerned with recognition of isolated words. The program computes measures of orthographic similarity online, with respect to either a default vocabulary of 31,491 Spanish words or a vocabulary specified by the user. In addition to providing standard orthographic and phonological neighborhood measures, the program can be used to obtain information about other forms of orthographic similarity, such as transposed-letter similarity and embedded-word similarity.

abstract = {Competence-based theories of island effects play a central role in generative grammar, yet the graded nature of many syntactic islands has never been properly accounted for. Categorical syn- tactic accounts of island effects have persisted in spite of a wealth of data suggesting that island ef- fects are not categorical in nature and that nonstructural manipulations that leave island structures intact can radically alter judgments of island violations. We argue here, building on work by Paul Deane, Robert Kluender, and others, that processing factors have the potential to account for this otherwise unexplained variation in acceptability judgments. We report the results of self-paced reading experiments and controlled acceptability studies that explore the relationship between processing costs and judgments of acceptability. In each of the three self-paced reading studies, the data indicate that the processing cost of different types of is- land violations can be significantly reduced to a degree comparable to that of nonisland filler-gap constructions by manipulating a single nonstructural factor. Moreover, this reduction in process- ing cost is accompanied by significant improvements in acceptability. This evidence favors the hy- pothesis that island-violating constructions involve numerous processing pressures that aggregate to drive processing difficulty above a threshold, resulting in unacceptability. We examine the im- plications of these findings for the grammar of filler-gap dependencies.},

abstract = {Cities are complex systems, a particular dimension largely contributing to the complexity of cities is detected in the multiplicity of the behaviour of people who inhabit. In the urban con- text, these behaviours can be inferred from human activities. Understanding the distinctions of these activities between cities is crucial. Previous works carry out such studies using sur- veys, censuses, interviews and onsite observations, which are rather costly, requiring extensive human or other resources. With the development of Internet and information technology, the geo-referenced social media networks which link human activities to specific places have been more and more popular. It, therefore, becomes a good candidate for studying individual human activities in the city. In this work, we explore to what extent can social media data be used for studying differences of individual human activities in an urban environment, considering im- pacts of three aspects: the choice of social media platforms, the user roles and demographics, and the various of Point of Interests (PoIs). To perform this study, we design an experiment to compare user activities on multiple social media platforms in Rotterdam and Shenzhen. A pipeline for crawling and enrichingWeibo data is developed and encapsulated as an extension to the Social-Glass framework. A novel dataset containing data from four platforms (i.e. Twit- ter, Instagram, Foursquare andWeibo) in two cities for two weeks is created and analysed at a disaggregate level across several dimensions. Results indicate that, in the context of user ac- tivity study, Twitter andWeibo shows distinct differences for resident regarding local, general, and neutral topics particularly for young and mid-age users on Twitter, and for teen and young users onWeibo. While, Instagram shows evident differences for non-residents concerning in- ternational, specific, daily and emotional topics, especially for young and mid-age users. In the meantime, various PoIs provide significant differences in user activity. Thesis},

Annotated corpora promise to be valu- able for enterprises as diverse as the automatic construction of statistical models for the grammar of the written and the colloquial spoken language, the development of explicit formal theories of the differing grammars of writing and speech, the investi- gation of prosodic phenomena in speech, and the evaluation and comparison of the adequacy of parsing models.},

These patterns are compared to those of Madrid Spanish (MS), compare Face (2002). In LS, accents are realized as pitch rises rather than falls, like in MS and unlike in LB, but peaks are aligned before the offset of the accented syllable, unlike in MS and like in LB. At the end of the subject phrase, peaks display later alignment, like in MS. Thus, LS displays mixed properties of Basque and Spanish intonation. In VS, stress is also realized as a tonal rise, with peaks aligned after the offset of the accented syllable, like in other varieties of Spanish and unlike LS. The low tone target is aligned before the onset of the stressed syllable, earlier than in LS and MS. The continuum of tonal target alignment is observed in LS, VS, and MS, and the difficulties in identifying a "starred" tone lead to a discussion of the suitability of the starred tone notation.},

In a previous study, I reviewed many of these measures and suggested an alternative measure, DP (for 'deviation of proportions'), which I argued to be conceptually simpler and more versatile than many competing measures. However, despite the relevance of dispersion for virtually all corpus-linguistic work, it is still a very much under-researched topic: to the best of my knowledge, there is not a single study investigating how different measures compare to each other when applied to large datasets, nor is there any work that attempts to determine how different measures match up with the kind of psycholinguistic data that dispersions and adjusted frequencies are supposed to represent. This article takes exploratory steps in both of these directions.},

abstract = {The familiar mathematical topics of introductory statistics — means, proportions, t-tests, normal and t distributions, chi-squared, etc. — are a product of the first half of the 20th century. Naturally, they reflect the statistical conditions of that era: scarce, e.g. n {\textless} 10, data originating in benchtop or agricultural experiments; algorithms communicated via algebraic formulas. Today, applied statistics relates to a different environment: software is the means of algorithmic communication, observational and " unplanned " data are interpreted for causal relationships, and data are large both in n and the number of variables. This change in situation calls for a thorough rethinking of the topics in and approach to statistics education. (Cobb 2015) In this paper, I present a set of ten organizing blocks for intro stats that, I claim, are better suited to today's environment. 1. Data tables 2. Data graphics 3. Model functions 4. Model training 5. Effect size and covariates 6. Displays of distributions 7. Bootstrap replication 8. Prediction error 9. Comparing models 10. Generalization and causality The extent of each theme, and the division of the whole into ten blocks, has been made with an eye toward covering each in roughly one week of a standard course. Keeping in mind that one of the drivers of change in statistics has been the transition from algebra to software as the mode of describing algorithms, computing should be integrated thoroughly across blocks. I'll illustrate the sorts of algorithms that support the themes using two new packages for R: ggformula and mosaicModel. These packages integrate data-science software such as the tidyverse (Wickham and Grolemund 2016) with the pedagogical approach of the mosaic package (Pruim, Kaplan, and Horton 2017). The discussion and computer commands in this paper are oriented toward instructors. An implementation of the blocks for students should take another form, one with much more basic and expository narrative and interactive scaffolding for computer commands.},

abstract = {Greek speakers say "omicronupsilonrho", Germans "schwanz" and the French "queue" to describe what English speakers call a 'tail', but all of these languages use a related form of 'two' to describe the number after one. Among more than 100 Indo-European languages and dialects, the words for some meanings (such as 'tail') evolve rapidly, being expressed across languages by dozens of unrelated words, while others evolve much more slowly--such as the number 'two', for which all Indo-European language speakers use the same related word-form. No general linguistic mechanism has been advanced to explain this striking variation in rates of lexical replacement among meanings. Here we use four large and divergent language corpora (English, Spanish, Russian and Greek) and a comparative database of 200 fundamental vocabulary meanings in 87 Indo-European languages to show that the frequency with which these words are used in modern language predicts their rate of replacement over thousands of years of Indo-European language evolution. Across all 200 meanings, frequently used words evolve at slower rates and infrequently used words evolve more rapidly. This relationship holds separately and identically across parts of speech for each of the four language corpora, and accounts for approximately 50{\%} of the variation in historical rates of lexical replacement. We propose that the frequency with which specific words are used in everyday language exerts a general and law-like influence on their rates of evolution. Our findings are consistent with social models of word change that emphasize the role of selection, and suggest that owing to the ways that humans use language, some words will evolve slowly and others rapidly across all languages.},

Aspects of that experience, for instance, the frequency of use of certain constructions or particular instances of constructions, have an impact on representation that is evidenced in speaker knowledge of conventionalized phrases and in language variation and change. It is shown that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonolog- ical characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency in- stances under the pressure of newer formations. An exemplar model that accommodates both phonological and semantic representation is elaborated to describe the data considered.*},

Pronunciation has been accorded little importance within recent methodological approaches, although their stated goals of communication and intelligibility in fact require the incorporation of explicit phonetics instruction in the language classroom. Considering the first-year Spanish L2 classroom, I propose a phonetics program based on the notion of a learner's dialect (cf. Bergen, 1974). I then measure the phonetics presentation of 10 Spanish textbooks against a learner's dialect, and find that pronunciation sections are in most cases incomplete and inaccurate and provide for no self-monitoring or recycling. This article argues against the current trend reflected in these texts, which relegates pronunciation to the laboratory manual or eliminates it altogether.},

abstract = {Our understanding of human learning is increasingly informed by findings from multiple fields—psychology, neuroscience, computer science, linguistics, and education. A convergence of insights is forging a “new science of learning” within cognitive science, which promises to play a key role in developing intelligent machines (1, 2). A long-standing fundamental issue in theories of human learning is whether there are specialized learning mechanisms for certain tasks or spheres of activity (domains). For example, is learning how to open a door (turning the handle before pulling) the same kind of “learning” as putting up and taking down scaffolding (where disassembly must be done in the reverse order of assembly)? Surprisingly, this issue plays out within the domain of human language.},

Here, we show that a Bayesian model can learn a standard poverty-of-stimulus example, anaphoric one, from realistic input by relying on indirect evidence, without a linguistic constraint assumed to be necessary. Our demonstration does, however, assume other linguistic knowledge; thus, we reduce the problem of learning anaphoric one to that of learning this other knowledge. We discuss whether this other knowledge may itself be acquired without linguistic constraints.},

Computation provides access to information in text that we simply cannot gather using traditional qualitative methods of close reading and human synthesis. Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature provides a practical introduction to computational text analysis using the open source programming language R. R is extremely popular throughout the sciences and because of its accessibility, R is now used increasingly in other research areas. Readers begin working with text right away and each chapter works through a new technique or process such that readers gain a broad exposure to core R procedures and a basic understanding of the possibilities of computational text analysis at both the micro and macro scale. Each chapter builds on the previous as readers move from small scale “microanalysis” of single texts to large scale “macroanalysis” of text corpora, and each chapter concludes with a set of practice exercises that reinforce and expand upon the chapter lessons. The book's focus is on making the technical palatable and making the technical useful and immediately gratifying.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning are in a period of astounding growth. However, there are concerns that these technologies may be used, either with or without intention, to perpetuate the prejudice and unfairness that unfortunately characterizes many human institutions. Here we show for the first time that human-like semantic biases result from the application of standard machine learning to ordinary language---the same sort of language humans are exposed to every day. We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model---namely, the GloVe word embedding---trained on a corpus of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the {\{}$\backslash$em status quo{\}} for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT). Our results have implications not only for AI and machine learning, but also for the fields of psychology, sociology, and human ethics, since they raise the possibility that mere exposure to everyday language can account for the biases we replicate here.},

One specific approach put forward is MuDPaR which in essence incorporates mixed-effect modeling and machine learning methods to bring the nature of the variable studied into clear view.

Also notes, at the end of the article, that analyses based on observational data have the potential to be more informative given that analyses based on controlled experimental data given the latter superimposes a balanced exposure to stimuli which is not observed in real-world use (which is Zipfian in nature). This has the effect of simplifying the statistical analysis, when compared to observational analyses, but at a cost --how the experimental session itself influences behavior is not known can cannot (easily) be modeled/ factored out.},

@phdthesis{Curran2003,
abstract = {Lexical-semantic resources, including thesauri and WORDNET, have been successfully incorporated into a wide range of applications in Natural Language Processing. However they are very difficult and expensive to create and maintain, and their usefulness has been severely hampered by their limited coverage, bias and inconsistency. Automated and semi-automated methods for developing such resources are therefore crucial for further resource development and improved application performance. Systems that extract thesauri often identify similar words using the distributional hypothesis that similar words appear in similar contexts. This approach involves using corpora to examine the contexts each word appears in and then calculating the similarity between context distributions. Different definitions of context can be used, and I begin by examining how different types of extracted context influence similarity. To be of most benefit these systems must be capable of finding synonyms for rare words. Reliable context counts for rare events can only be extracted from vast collections of text. In this dissertation I describe how to extract contexts from a corpus of over 2 billion words. I describe techniques for processing text on this scale and examine the trade-off between context accuracy, information content and quantity of text analysed. Distributional similarity is at best an approximation to semantic similarity. I develop improved approximations motivated by the intuition that some events in the context distribution are more indicative of meaning than others. For instance, the object-of-verb context wear is far more indicative of a clothing noun than get. However, existing distributional techniques do not effectively utilise this information. The new context-weighted similarity metric I propose in this dissertation significantly outperforms every distributional similarity metric described in the literature. Nearest-neighbour similarity algorithms scale poorly with vocabulary and context vector size. To overcome this problem I introduce a new context-weighted approximation algorithm with bounded complexity in context vector size that significantly reduces the system runtime with only a minor performance penalty. I also describe a parallelized version of the system that runs on a Beowulf cluster for the 2 billion word experiments. To evaluate the context-weighted similarity measure I compare ranked similarity lists against gold-standard resources using precision and recall-based measures from Information Retrieval, since the alternative, application-based evaluation, can often be influenced by distributional as well as semantic similarity. I also perform a detailed analysis of the final results using WORDNET. Finally, I apply my similarity metric to the task of assigning words to WORDNET semantic categories. I demonstrate that this new approach outperforms existing methods and overcomes some of their weaknesses.},

Furthermore, we discuss what problems have emerged, highlight which software tools have been found to be useful, and identify which tools are re-usable across different languages. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the error detection programs are effective and that our tagger combination method is crucial with regard to the amount of hand-correction that must be carried out in future work.

The three steps include using top 100 most frequent words, a second-order Markov Model trigram character model, and the use of a highly indicative (unique) words from each language.

Adding the steps together results increase to .99 recall and .99 precision.},

abstract = {Language in social media is rich with linguistic innovations, most strikingly in the new words and spellings that constantly enter the lexicon. Despite assertions about the power of social media to connect people across the world, we find that many of these neologisms are restricted to geographically compact areas. Even for words that become ubiquituous, their growth in popularity is often geographical, spreading from city to city. Thus, social media text offers a unique opportunity to study the diffusion of lexical change. In this paper, we show how an autoregressive model of word frequencies in social media can be used to induce a network of linguistic influence between American cities. By comparing the induced network with the geographical and demographic characteristics of each city, we can measure the factors that drive the spread of lexical innovation.},

abstract = {Typology has a low profile in much of American linguistics, especially outside of phonology (Nichols 2007, Hyman 2007, Van Valin 2007). Yet, as I will suggest, the study of the results and methods of modern typology has important lessons for us as the field of linguistics undergoes a paradigm shift. Typologists study a wide range of language types, but I will show that even when one does theoretical work on a single, well-studied standardized national language like English, one can (and should) benefit from an awareness of typological findings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
annote = {From Duplicate 1 (A few lessons from typology - Bresnan, Joan)

Linguistic evidence: should be ecologically valid and be analyzed with appropriate modeling techniques

Affectedness Constraint: possesive nominalization

(1) the city's destruction / *the problem's perception

destruction -{\textgreater} affects -{\textgreater} city
perception -{\textgreater} not affects -{\textgreater} problem

Relative informativeness appears to be a more robust predictor from usage accounts. Shows that the boundary of what is grammatical was located incorrectly through traditional methods (--this makes me think that the argument is that usage models will not err, which is incorrect too!)

Dative alternation: double object/ prepositional object

(3) That movie gave me the creeps. / *That movie gave the creeps to me. 

Lexical semantic explanation does not hold:

(4) The prop will give the creeps to just about anyone.

Examples in the literature (like 3) tend to contain short pronominal referents but the usage examples (like 4) tend to have nonpronominal referents which are larger in length that the theme NP.

Again, the boundary is misplaced --usage accounts are more informative.

Errors such as these are present in much theorizing about language via tranditional introspective methods:

- underestimate the space of grammar
- reflect relative frequency (instead of categorical grammaticality)
- overlook complex constrain interactions and processing effects
- fail to address the problems of investigator bias and social intervention

UPSHOT: Linguistic intuitions of ungrammaticality
are a poor guide to the space of grammatical possibility. Usage data reveals generalizations which we are sometimes blind to. Typology helps us to discover and evaluate patterns in the data.

This is not to say that judgments do not play a part, only that ratings are one source of data that need to be evaluated using observations from ecological valid language use.},

abstract = {The question of whether humans represent grammatical knowledge as a binary condition on membership in a set of wellformed sentences, or as a probabilistic property has been the subject of debate among linguists, psychologists, and cognitive scientists for many decades. Acceptability judgments present a serious problem for both classical binary and probabilistic theories of grammaticality. These judgements are gradient in nature, and so cannot be directly accommodated in a binary formal grammar. However, it is also not possible to simply reduce acceptability to probability. The acceptability of a sentence is not the same as the likelihood of its occurrence, which is, in part, determined by factors like sentence length and lexical frequency. In this paper, we present the results of a set of largescale experiments using crowdsourced acceptability judgments that demonstrate gradience to be a pervasive feature in acceptability judgments. We then show how one can predict acceptability judgments on the basis of probability by augmenting probabilistic language models with an acceptability measure. This is a function that normalizes probability values to eliminate the confounding factors of length and lexical frequency. We describe a sequence of modeling experiments with unsupervised language models drawn from stateoftheart machine learning methods in natural language processing. Several of these models achieve very encouraging levels of accuracy in the acceptability prediction task, as measured by the correlation between the acceptability measure scores and mean human acceptability values. We consider the relevance of these results to the debate on the nature of grammatical competence, and we argue that they support the view that linguistic knowledge can be intrinsically probabilistic.},

We analyze which textual features have most predictive power for these datasets, providing insight into the connections between the language of food, geographic locale, and community characteristics. Lastly, we design and implement an online system for real-time query and visualization of the dataset. Visualization tools, such as geo-referenced heatmaps, semantics-preserving wordclouds and temporal histograms, allow us to discover more complex, global patterns mirrored in the language of food.},

abstract = {In this study we examine linguistic variation and its dependence on both social and geographic factors. We follow dialectometry in applying a quantitative methodology and focusing on dialect distances, and social dialectology in the choice of factors we examine in building a model to predict word pronunciation distances from the standard Dutch language to 424 Dutch dialects. We combine linear mixed-effects regression modeling with generalized additive modeling to predict the pronunciation distance of 559 words. Although geographical position is the dominant predictor, several other factors emerged as significant. The model predicts a greater distance from the standard for smaller communities, for communities with a higher average age, for nouns (as contrasted with verbs and adjectives), for more frequent words, and for words with relatively many vowels. The impact of the demographic variables, however, varied from word to word. For a majority of words, larger, richer and younger communities are moving towards the standard. For a smaller minority of words, larger, richer and younger communities emerge as driving a change away from the standard. Similarly, the strength of the effects of word frequency and word category varied geographically. The peripheral areas of the Netherlands showed a greater distance from the standard for nouns (as opposed to verbs and adjectives) as well as for high-frequency words, compared to the more central areas. Our findings indicate that changes in pronunciation have been spreading (in particular for low-frequency words) from the Hollandic center of economic power to the peripheral areas of the country, meeting resistance that is stronger wherever, for well-documented historical reasons, the political influence of Holland was reduced. Our results are also consistent with the theory of lexical diffusion, in that distances from the Hollandic norm vary systematically and predictably on a word by word basis.},

We present a pseudoword generator that improves on current methods. It allows for the generation of written polysyllabic pseudowords that obey a given language's phonotactic constraints. Given a word or nonword template, the algorithm can quickly generate pseudowords that match the template in subsyllabic structure and transition frequencies without having to search through a list with all possible candidates. Currently, the program is available for Dutch, English, German, French, Spanish, Serbian, and Basque, and, with little effort, it can be expanded to other languages.},

@incollection{Myers2017,
abstract = {Acceptability judgments are reports of a speaker‟s or signer‟s subjective sense of the well-formedness, nativeness, or naturalness of (novel) linguistic forms. Their value comes in providing data about the nature of the human capacity to generalize beyond linguistic forms previously encountered in language comprehension. For this reason, acceptability judgments are often also called grammaticality judgments (particularly in syntax), although unlike the theory-dependent notion of grammaticality, acceptability is accessible to consciousness. While acceptability judgments have been used to test grammatical claims since ancient times, they became particularly prominent with the birth of generative syntax. Today they are also widely used in other linguistic schools (e.g., cognitive linguistics) and other linguistic domains (pragmatics, semantics, morphology, and phonology), and have been applied in a typologically diverse range of languages. As psychological responses to linguistic stimuli, acceptability judgments are experimental data. Their value thus depends on the validity of the experimental procedures, which, in their traditional version (where theoreticians elicit judgments from themselves or a few colleagues), have been criticized as overly informal and biased. Traditional responses to such criticisms have been supplemented in recent years by laboratory experiments that use formal psycholinguistic methods to collect and quantify judgments from non-linguists under controlled conditions. Such formal experiments have played an increasingly influential role in theoretical linguistics, being used to justify subtle judgment claims or new grammatical 1 models that incorporate gradience or lexical influences. They have also been used to probe the cognitive processes giving rise to the sense of acceptability itself, the central finding being that acceptability reflects processing ease. Exploring what this finding means will require not only further empirical work on the acceptability judgment process, but also theoretical work on the nature of grammar.},

abstract = {The question of whether or not grammatical factors can condition or block sound change has been discussed from many perspectives for more than a century without resolution (Melchert, 1975). Here we consider studies of sound change in progress which show that words or phrases that are used frequently in the phonetic environment for change undergo the change before those whose use is less frequent in these contexts. Because words of different categories and with different structures also have different distributions, they may occur preferentially in certain phonetic environments. Thus, some apparent cases of influence by grammatical and lexical factors can be explained by phonetic factors if we expand our notion of phonetic environment to include frequency within the environment for change, which includes the segmental environment as well as factors that affect the degree of prominence a word receives in context.},

abstract = {Computer-mediated communication (CMC) affords many CMC cues which augment the verbal content of the message: all uppercase letters, asterisks, emoticons, punctuation marks, chronemics (time-related messages) and letter repetitions, to name a few. Letter repetitions are unique CMC cues in that they appear to be a written emulation of a spoken paralinguistic cue - phoneme extension. In this study we explore letter repetitions as a CMC cue, with specific emphasis on elucidating the link between them and spoken nonverbal cues. The letter repetitions are studied in the Enron Corpus, a large ecologically valid collection (???500,000) of e-mail messages sent by and to employees of the Enron Corporation. We conclude that letter repetitions in the corpus often, but not always, emulate spoken nonverbal cues. This conclusion is examined in a longitudinal analysis that demonstrates the dynamic nature of this cue, and suggests that the usage of letter repetitions is increasing over time, while the link to spoken language is diminishing. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of verb biases in$\backslash$nnormal comprehension have been well documented in previous studies (e.$\backslash$ng., Spivey-Knowlton Sedivy, 1995; Trueswell, Tanenhaus, {\&} Kello,$\backslash$n1993), but their role in aphasic language processing has largely been$\backslash$nignored (with the exceptions of Menn et al., 1998, and Russo, Peach, {\&}$\backslash$nShapiro, 1998).$\backslash$nAims: The aim of the study is to test the lexical bias hypothesis,$\backslash$ni.e., the hypothesis that sentence comprehension is influenced by$\backslash$nlexical biases in aphasic listeners, as well as in normals.$\backslash$nMethod {\&} Procedures: Using a sentence plausibility judgement task, we$\backslash$nprobe for sensitivity to verb transitivity bias, i.e., the likelihood,$\backslash$nas estimated from corpus counts, that a verb will be transitive, rather$\backslash$nthan intransitive. Five normal controls and eighteen participants with$\backslash$naphasia (six with Broca's aphasia, four with Wernicke's aphasia, two$\backslash$nwith conduction aphasia, and six with anomic aphasia) are included in$\backslash$nthe study. Based on the lexical bias hypothesis, we predicted that$\backslash$nparticipants would make more errors in sentences with a mismatch of$\backslash$nverb bias and syntactic structure, such as a transitive sentence$\backslash$ncontaining a verb with intransitive bias.$\backslash$nOutcomes {\&} Results: Both the group of normal controls and the mixed$\backslash$ngroup of aphasic patients make significantly more errors on sentences$\backslash$nin which there is a mismatch between verb bias and syntactic structure,$\backslash$nas predicted by the lexical bias hypothesis. Specifically, patients$\backslash$nwith fluent aphasia types, particularly anomic aphasia, show a$\backslash$nsensitivity to verb bias, contrary to earlier findings.$\backslash$nConclusions: These results are consistent with the view that lexical$\backslash$nfactors, not purely syntactic ones, are to blame for many previously$\backslash$nobserved patterns in aphasic comprehension. The results are further$\backslash$nconsistent with the view that many aphasic errors differ not$\backslash$nqualitatively but quantitatively from normal comprehension errors.},

abstract = {Much statistical analysis of psycholinguistic data is now being done with so-called mixed-effects regression models. This development was spearheaded by a few highly influential introductory articles that (i) showed how these regression models are superior to what was the previous gold standard and, perhaps even more importantly, (ii) showed how these models are used practically. Corpus linguistics can benefit from mixed-effects/multi-level models for the same reason that psycholinguistics can - because, for example, speaker-specific and lexically specific idiosyncrasies can be accounted for elegantly; but, in fact, corpus linguistics needs them even more because (i) corpus-linguistic data are observational and, thus, usually unbalanced and messy/noisy, and (ii) most widely used corpora come with a hierarchical structure that corpus linguists routinely fail to consider. Unlike nearly all overviews of mixed-effects/multi-level modelling, this paper is specifically written for corpus linguists to get more of them to start using these techniques more. After a short methodological history, I provide a nontechnical introduction to mixed-effects models and then discuss in detail one example - particle placement in English - to show how mixed-effects/multilevel modelling results can be obtained and how they are far superior to those of traditional regression modelling. {\textcopyright} Edinburgh University Press.},

abstract = {Judgments about the grammaticalitylacceptability of sentences are the most widely used data source in the syntactic literature. Typically, syntacticians rely on their own judgments, or those of a small number of colleagues. Although a number of researchers have argued that this is problematic, there is little research which systematically compares professional linguists' intuitions with those of linguistically naive speakers. This article examines linguists' and nonlinguists' judgments about one particular structure: questions with long distance dependencies. Linguists' judgments are shown to diverge from those of nonlinguists. These differences could be due to theoretical commitments (the conviction that linguistic processes apply 'across the board', and hence all sentences with the same syntactic structure should be equally grammatical) or to differences in exposure (the constructed examples of this structure found in the syntactic literature are very unrepresentative of ordinary usage). Whichever of these explanations turns out to be correct, it is clear that linguists' judgments are not representative of the population as a whole, and hence syntacticians should not rely on their own intuitions when testing their theories.},
annote = {The upshot of this article is that linguists and non-linguists differ systematically in terms of their acceptability ratings of wh-questions, declaratives and a few classic wh-islands. For Wh-questions and declaratives, the difference lies in the degree of acceptability, linguists like wh-questions more than the declaratives (in this study--which are all prefixed with a conjunction). It is also the case that the linguists contrast with non-linguists in the degree of difference between the grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Non-linguists tend to rate sentencs more in the middle of the scale.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}An interesting idea explored here is that the attested corpus frequency of lexical frames tends to affect ratings from non-linguists but not linguists. },

In this article, we analyse reading aloud and lexical decision reaction times and accuracy rates for 2,336 words to assess the influence of subjective frequency and age of acquisition on performance. Specifically, we compare newly presented word frequency measures with the existing frequency norms of Kucera and Francis (1967), HAL (Burgess {\&} Livesay, 1998), Brysbaert and New (2009), and Zeno, Ivens, Millard, and Duvvuri (1995). We show that the use of the Kucera and Francis word frequency measure accounts for much less variance than the other word frequencies, which leaves more variance to be "explained" by familiarity ratings and age-of-acquisition ratings. We argue that subjective frequency ratings are no longer needed if researchers have good objective word frequency counts. The effect of age of acquisition remains significant and has an effect size that is of practical relevance, although it is substantially smaller than that of the first phoneme in naming and the objective word frequency in lexical decision. Thus, our results suggest that models of word processing need to utilize these recently developed frequency estimates during training or setting baseline activation levels in the lexicon.},

In three different syntactic environments, the preferred (most frequent) syntactic frame associated with a verb facilitated sentence processing relative to less-preferred (more infrequent) frames. Speed-accuracy tradeoff measures were used to explicitly examine whether the preferred frame associated with the verb has a higher probability of retrieval from the mental lexicon or whether it induces a serial parsing strategy. SAT analysis indicated that (i) in most contexts, less-preferred frames have a lower probability of retrieval, and (ii) verb preference does not induce a serial parsing strategy in the processing of lexically realized arguments, but may induce a serial assignment of possible filler-gap relations.},

abstract = {Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

abstract = {The importance of vocabulary in reading comprehension emphasizes the need to accurately assess an individual's familiarity with words. The present article highlights problems with using occurrence counts in corpora as an index of word familiarity, especially when studying individuals varying in reading experience. We demonstrate via computational simulations and norming studies that corpus-based word frequencies systematically overestimate strengths of word representations, especially in the low-frequency range and in smaller-size vocabularies. Experience-driven differences in word familiarity prove to be faithfully captured by the subjective frequency ratings collected from responders at different experience levels. When matched on those levels, this lexical measure explains more variance than corpus-based frequencies in eye-movement and lexical decision latencies to English words, attested in populations with varied reading experience and skill. Furthermore, the use of subjective frequencies removes the widely reported (corpus) Frequency × Skill interaction, showing that more skilled readers are equally faster in processing any word than the less skilled readers, not disproportionally faster in processing lower frequency words. This finding challenges the view that the more skilled an individual is in generic mechanisms of word processing, the less reliant he or she will be on the actual lexical characteristics of that word.},

abstract = {The Internet may be a part of two very different social trends. On the one hand, the emergence of the inter-regional networks and systems of interaction and exchange of globalization has encouraged the spread of English. On the other hand, the ease and relatively cheap cost of using information technology allows any language group to produce its own sites, journals and programmes. There are thus two research questions to be addressed from a socio-linguistic perspective: is the Internet actually leading to greater contact across language boundaries and is it indeed English that is the preferred medium for such exchanges? And what could be the possible role of the Internet in the maintenance and revitalization of lesser used languages. The present issue, whose research was undertaken in the framework of UNESCO's multidisciplinary project Initiative B@bel, reports on the first tranche of this research programme.},

Therefore, decision tree analysis may help establish cutoff points when continuous data are converted into categories for Varbrul. Data sets containing knockouts and multinomial dependent variables, as well as those containing cells with zeros, are a challenge for Varbrul analysis. These are usually dealt with by recoding and reconfiguring the data. However, in some cases no amount of principled recoding is able to yield a parsimonious Varbrul analysis. Therefore, decision trees are suggested as an alternative method of analysis since they are not adversely affected by these factors. In order to contrast and compare the two methods, Varbrul and decision tree analyses of a number of linguistic data sets are presented.},

Our main observation is the existence of a dissociation between regular and irregular processes in the distribution of errors: regular suffixes and unmarked (non-alternating) stems are over-extended to irregulars in children's inflection errors, but not vice versa. We also found that overregularization errors at all ages are only a small minority of the children's irregular verbs, that the period of overregularization is preceded by a stage without errors, and that the onset of over-regularizations is connected to the emergence of obligatory finiteness markings. These findings are explained in terms of the dual-mechanism model of inflection.},

It is found that contextually dependent Superiority constructions are more acceptable and read faster which suggests a processing, not grammatical, account. The intuition is that the contextual Wh-item is more salient in memory and easier to recover.

abstract = {Talk of linguistic universals has given cognitive scientists the impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of "universal," we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition. Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels. Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in human language opens up exciting new research directions for cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural experiments given by different languages, with new opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned with change and diversity, and confronting us with the extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills.},

Multiple studies document that quality of care is compromised when LEP patients need but do not get interpreters. LEP patients' quality of care is inferior, and more interpreter errors occur with untrained ad hoc interpreters. Inadequate interpreter services can have serious consequences for patients with mental disorders. Trained professional interpreters and bilingual health care providers positively affect LEP patients' satisfaction, quality of care, and outcomes. Evidence suggests that optimal communication, patient satisfaction, and outcomes and the fewest interpreter errors occur when LEP patients have access to trained professional interpreters or bilingual providers.},

Although the approaches to date have offered different possibilities for constructing collocation networks, we argue that they have not yet successfully operationalized some of the desired features of such networks. In this study, we revisit the concept of collocation networks and introduce GraphColl, a new tool developed by the authors that builds collocation networks from user-defined corpora. In a case study using data from McEnery's (2006a) study of the Society for the Reformation of Manners Corpus (SRMC), we demonstrate that collocation networks provide important insights into meaning relationships in language.},

This hypothesis has sparked both enthusiasm and controversy, but despite its prominence it has only occasionally been addressed in computational terms. Recent developments support a view of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in terms of probabilistic inference. This view may resolve some of the controversy surrounding the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and may help to normalize the hypothesis by linking it to established principles that also explain other phenomena. On this view, effects of language on non-linguistic cognition or perception reflect standard principles of inference under uncertainty.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine the frequency of the active and passive verb forms in two astrophysics journal articles, finding that we plus an active verb occurs at least as frequently as the passive in both articles. On the basis of consultation with an informant in astrophysics we find that astrophysics papers typify a previously unidentified type of research article, the logical argument scientific paper; in this type of paper, the rhetorical structure is quite different from that of the ‘standard scientific' experimental paper. Within the structure of the logical argument paper, we propose four rhetorical functions of the passive as opposed to we plus an active verb: (1) we indicates the author's procedural choice, while the passive indicates an established or standard procedure; (2) we is used to describe the author's own work and the passive to describe the work of others, unless that work is not mentioned in contrast to the author's in which case the active is used; (3) the passive is used to describe the author's proposed studies; and (4) the use of the active or the passive is determined by focus due to the length of an element or the need for emphasis. We suggest that similar uses of the passive and active voice may also extend to English journal papers in other fields, particularly those in which the subject matter does not lend itself to experimentation, and in which papers take the form of a logical argument rather than an experimental study. We review evidence produced subsequent to this study which suggests that astrophysics papers written in Russian may use the equivalent of the passive and active voice in a similar way to that described for English.},

The first stage parser assigns lexical and phrasal nodes to substrings of roughly six words. The second stage parser then adds higher nodes to link these phrasal packages together into a complete phrase marker.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis model of the parser is compared with ATN models, and with the two-stage models of Kimball (1973) and Fodor, Bever and Garrett (1974). Our assumption that the units which are shunted from the first stage to the second stage are defined by their length, rather than by their syntactic type, explains the effects of constituent length on perceptual complexity in center embedded sentences and in sentences of the kind that fall under Kimball's principle of Right Association. The particular division of labor between the two parsing units allows us to explain, without appeal to any ad hoc parsing strategies, why the parser makes certain ‘shortsighted' errors even though, in general, it is able to make intelligent use of all the information that is available to it.},

abstract = {In author attribution studies function words or lexical measures are often used to differ- entiate the authors' textual fingerprints. These studies can be thought of as quantifying the texts, representing the text with measured variables that stand for specific textual features. The resulting quantifications, while proven useful for statistically differentiating among the texts, bear no resem- blance to the understanding texts. In this paper we present an attribution study that, instead, characterizes the texts according to the representational come to know a text and distinguish its rhetorical purpose. From our automated quantification a human reader - even an astute one - would develop while reading the language choices of the authors, similar to a way we believe close human readers of The Federalist papers, it is clear why human readers find it impossible to distinguish the authorship of the disputed papers. Our findings suggest that changes occur in the processes of rhetorical invention when undertaken in collaborative situations. This points to a need to re-evaluate the premise of autonomous authorship that has informed attribution studies of The Federalist case.},

The phenomenon of judgment satiation, in which certain unacceptable sentence types improve upon repeated exposure, is used here to provide new evidence addressing this issue. It is shown that unacceptable wh-questions in Spanish are susceptible to satiation, but their counterparts in English are not, thus suggesting that different mechanisms are responsible for the inversion effect in the two languages. In addition to providing new evidence regarding the nature of inversion in wh-questions, this study also constitutes a test case for using satiation in the service of comparative syntax.},

Stylometry (computational stylistics) is concerned with the quantitative study of writing style, e.g. authorship verification, an application which has considerable potential in forensic contexts, as well as historical research. In this paper we introduce the possibilities of stylo for computational text analysis, via a number of dummy case studies from English and French literature. We demonstrate how the package is particularly useful in the exploratory statistical analysis of texts, e.g. with respect to authorial writing style. Because stylo provides an attractive graphical user interface for high-level exploratory analyses, it is especially suited for an audience of novices, without programming skills (e.g. from the Digital Humanities). More experienced users can benefit from our implementation of a series of standard pipelines for text processing, as well as a number of similarity metrics.},

Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods—they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.},

Our ability to communicate relies in part upon a shared emotional experience, with stories often following distinct emotional trajectories, forming patterns that are meaningful to us. Here, by classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 1,737 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a set of six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex narratives. We strengthen our findings by separately applying optimization, linear decomposition, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. For each of these six core emotional arcs, we examine the closest characteristic stories in publication today and find that particular emotional arcs enjoy greater success, as measured by downloads.},

This material helps the reader in several ways, for example: by giving a synopsis of the book, by explaining where the various data tables are and what they deal with, by telling what theory is described where. We did several distinct full studies for the Federalist papers as well as many minor side studies. Some or all may offer information both to the applied and the theoretical reader. We therefore try to give in this Contents more than the few cryptic words in a section heading to {\~{}}peed readers in finding what they want. Seconq, we have prepared an extra chapter dealing with authorship work published from. about 1969 to 1983. Although a chapter cannot compre- hensively Gover a field where many books now appear, it can mention most ofthe book-length works and the main thread of authorship' studies published in English. We founq biblical authorship studies so extensive and com- plicated that we thought it worthwhile to indicate some papers that would bring out the controversies that are taking place. We hope we have given the flavor of developments over the 15 years mentioned. We have also corrected a few typographical errors.},

This study contributes to an under-studied area of Latino linguistic practices by reporting the results of a study of CS in the emails of five Spanish-English bilingual Latinos. Methods are employed that are not often used in discourse analysis of email texts, namely multi-dimensional scaling and tree diagrams, to explore the contextual parameters of written Spanish-English CS systematically. Consistent with the findings of other studies of CS in CMC, English use was most associated with professional or formal contacts, and use of Spanish, the participants' native language, was linked to intimacy, informality, and group identification. Switches to Spanish functioned to personalize otherwise transactional or work-related English-dominant emails. The article also discusses novel orthographic and linguistic forms specific to the CMC context.},

The tentative results appear to concur with other studies: English is used as the lingua franca between interlocuters, but bilinguals tended to initiate emails in Spanish with other bilinguals.

abstract = {Attempts to quantify lexical variation have produced a large number of theoretical and empirical constructs, such as Word Frequency, Concreteness, and Ambiguity, which have been claimed to predict between-word differences in lexical processing behavior. Models of word recognition that have been developed to account for the effects of these variables have typically lacked adequate semantic representations, and have dealt with words as if they exist in isolation from their environment. We present a new dimension of lexical variation that is addressed to this concern. Contextual Distinctiveness (CD), a corpus-derived summary measure of the frequency distribution of the contexts in which a word occurs, is naturally compatible with contextual theories of semantic representation and meaning. Experiment 1 demonstrates that CD is a significantly better predictor of lexical decision latencies than occurrence frequency, suggesting that CD is the more psychologically relevant variable. We additionally explore the relationship between CD and six subjectively-defined measures: Concreteness, Context Availability, Number of Contexts, Ambiguity, Age of Acquisition and Familiarity and find CD to be reliably related to Ambiguity only. We argue for the priority of immediate context in determining the representation and processing of language.},

The applications based upon parallel corpora are numerous and growing in number: multilingual lexicography and terminology, machine and human translation, cross-language information retrieval, language learning, etc. The book's chapters have been commissioned from major figures in the field of parallel corpus building and exploitation, with the aim of showing the state of the art in parallel text alignment and use ten to fifteen years after the first parallel-text alignment techniques were developed. Within the book, the following broad themes are addressed: (i) techniques for the alignment of parallel texts at various levels such as sentence, clause, and word; (ii) the use of parallel texts in fields as diverse as translation, lexicography, and information retrieval; (iii) available corpus resources and the evaluation of alignment methods. The book will be of interest to researchers and advanced students of computational linguistics, terminology, lexicography and translation, both in academia and industry.},

However, three main issues remain still unresolved: (i) distinction of similar languages, (ii) detec-tion of multilingualism in a single document, and (iii) identifying the language of short texts. In this paper, we describe our work on the development of a benchmark to encourage further research in these three directions, set forth an evaluation frame-work suitable for the task, and make a dataset of annotated tweets publicly available for research purposes. We also describe the shared task we organized to validate and assess the evaluation framework and dataset with systems submitted by seven differ-ent participants, and analyze the performance of these systems. The evaluation of the results submitted by the participants of the shared task helped us shed some light on the shortcomings of state-of-the-art language identification systems, and gives insight into the extent to which the brevity, multilingualism, and language similarity found in texts exacerbate the performance of language identifiers. Our dataset with nearly 35,000 tweets and the evaluation framework provide researchers and practitioners with suitable resources to further study the aforementioned issues on language iden-tification within a common setting that enables to compare results with one another.},

abstract = {The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. We define metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and develop algorithms to "debias" the embedding. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.},

abstract = {A number of properties of word associations, generated in a continuous task, were investigated. First, we investigated the correspondence of word class in association cues and responses. Nouns were the modal word class response, regardless of the word class of the cue, indicating a dominant paradigmatic response style. Next, the word association data were used to build an associative network to investigate the centrality of nodes. The study of node centrality showed that central nodes in the network tended to be highly frequent and acquired early. Small-world properties of the association network were investigated and compared with a large English association network (Steyvers {\&} Tenenbaum, 2005). Networks based on a multiple association procedure showed small-world properties despitebeing denser than networks based on a discrete task. Finally, a semantic taxonomy was used to investigate the composition of semantic types in association responses. The majority of responses were thematically related situation responses and entity responses referring to parts, shape, or color. Since the association task required multiple responses per cue, the interaction between generation position and semantic role could be investigated and discussed in the framework of recent theories of natural concept representations (Barsalou, Santos, Simmons, {\&} Wilson, in press).},

abstract = {Fluent reading depends on a complex set of cognitive processes that must work together in perfect concert. Rapid automatized naming (RAN) tasks provide insight into this system, acting as a microcosm of the processes involved in reading. In this review, we examine both RAN and reading fluency and how each has shaped our understanding of reading disabilities. We explore the research that led to our current understanding of the relationships between RAN and reading and what makes RAN unique as a cognitive measure. We explore how the automaticity that supports RAN affects reading across development, reading abilities, and languages, and the biological bases of these processes. Finally, we bring these converging areas of knowledge together by examining what the collective studies of RAN and reading fluency contribute to our goals of creating optimal assessments and interventions that help every child become a fluent, comprehending reader.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth and popularity of mobile devices and location-aware technologies, online social networks such as Twitter have become an important data source for scientists to conduct geo-social network research. Non-personal accounts, spam users and junk tweets, however, pose severe problems to the extraction of meaningful information and the validation of any research findings on tweets or twitter users. Therefore, the detection of such users is a critical and fundamental step for twitter-related geographic research. In this study, we develop a methodological framework to: (1) extract user characteristics based on geographic, graph-based and content-based features of tweets; (2) construct a training dataset by manually inspecting and labeling a large sample of twitter users; and (3) derive reliable rules and knowledge for detecting non-personal users with supervised classification methods. The extracted geographic characteristics of a user include maximum speed, mean speed, the number of different counties that the user has been to, and others. Content-based characteristics for a user include the number of tweets per month, the percentage of tweets with URLs or Hashtags, and the percentage of tweets with emotions, detected with sentiment analysis. The extracted rules are theoretically interesting and practically useful. Specifically, the results show that geographic features, such as the average speed and frequency of county changes, can serve as important indicators of non-personal users. For non-spatial characteristics, the percentage of tweets with a high human factor index, the percentage of tweets with URLs, and the percentage of tweets with mentioned/replied users are the top three features in detecting non-personal users.},

By means of re-analyses of previously published data on Dutch words we show that the information residual outperforms the combination of traditional token- and type-based counts in predicting response latencies in visual lexical decision, and at the same time provides a parsimonious account of inflectional, derivational, and compounding processes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of the results shows that the dictionary approach yields agood core wordnet but requires substantial manual editing due to a lack of automatic word-sense disambiguation. This was successfully improved with the corpus approach which, however, was limited to single-word literals. The last approach, based on Wikipedia, was only used for domain-specific monosemous terms, and can deal with multi-word literals and therefore usefully complements the previous two approaches. The created sloWNet was then used to semantically annotate a corpus for Slovene: one hundred high frequency nouns were annotated in a corpus of 100,000 words. The paper reports on the method and results of this manual annotation. Both the Slovene wordnet and annotated corpus are to be publicly available.},

Themethod is applied to linguistic expressions at various levels of abstraction (words, semi-fixed phrases, argument structures, tense, aspect and mood). Themethod has two main applications: first, to increase the adequacy of grammatical description by providing an objective way of identifying themeaning of a grammatical construction and determining the degree to which particular slots in it prefer or are restricted to a particular set of lexemes; second, to provide data for linguistic theory-building.},

@book{Burdick2012,
abstract = {Digital{\_}Humanities is a compact, game-changing report on the state of contemporary knowledge production. Answering the question, “What is digital humanities?,” it provides an in-depth examination of an emerging field. This collaboratively authored and visually compelling volume explores methodologies and techniques unfamiliar to traditional modes of humanistic inquiry--including geospatial analysis, data mining, corpus linguistics, visualization, and simulation--to show their relevance for contemporary culture. Included are chapters on the basics, on emerging methods and genres, and on the social life of the digital humanities, along with “case studies,” “provocations,” and “advisories.” These persuasively crafted interventions offer a descriptive toolkit for anyone involved in the design, production, oversight, and review of digital projects. The authors argue that the digital humanities offers a revitalization of the liberal arts tradition in the electronically inflected, design-driven, multimedia language of the twenty-first century. Written by five leading practitioner-theorists whose varied backgrounds embody the intellectual and creative diversity of the field, Digital{\_}Humanities is a vision statement for the future, an invitation to engage, and a critical tool for understanding the shape of new scholarship.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple reconstructive procedures are common for the reconstruction of complex facial deformities of skin, soft tissues, bony structures, and functional subunits, such as the nose, lips, and eyelids. However, the results have been unsatisfactory. An innovative approach entailing a single surgical procedure of face allograft transplantation is a viable alternative and gives improved results. METHODS: On Dec 9, 2008, a 45-year-old woman with a history of severe midface trauma underwent near-total face transplantation in which 80{\%} of her face was replaced with a tailored composite tissue allograft. We addressed issues of immunosuppressive therapy, psychological and ethical outcomes, and re-integration of the patient into society. FINDINGS: After the operation, the patient did well physically and psychologically, and tolerated immunosuppression without any major complication. Routine biopsy on day 47 after transplantation showed rejection of graft mucosa; however, a single bolus of corticosteroids reversed rejection. During the first 3 weeks after transplantation, the patient accepted her new face; 6 months after surgery, the functional outcome has been excellent. In contrast to her status before transplantation, the patient can now breathe through her nose, smell, taste, speak intelligibly, eat solid foods, and drink from a cup. INTERPRETATION: We show the feasibility of reconstruction of severely disfigured patients in a single surgical procedure using composite face allotransplantation. Therefore, this should be taken in consideration as an early option for severely disfigured patients. FUNDING: None.},

abstract = {Studies in SLA have debated the importance of context of learning in the process of developing linguistic skills in a second language (L2). The present paper examines whether study abroad, as it provides opportunities for authentic L2 context, facilitates the acquisition of Spanish phonology. The corpus of this investigation is composed of speech samples from 46 students of Spanish: 26 studying abroad in Spain and 20 in a regular classroom environment in the United States. The students read a paragraph with 60 target words including segments such as word-initial stops (i.e., [p t k]),(1) intervocalic fricatives (i.e., [beta partial derivative v), word-final laterals (i.e., [1]), and palatal nasals (i.e., [eta]). The findings reveal the following patterns for both regular classroom and study abroad students across time: (a) similar gain in the case of voiced initial stops and word-final laterals, (b) lack of gain in the case of intervocalic fricatives, and (c) high levels of accuracy in the case of the palatal nasal in the pretest. Concerning the external data, the following factor groups predicted phonological gain among all learners: years of formal language instruction, reported use of Spanish before the semester, reported use of Spanish outside the classroom during the semester (days), reported use of Spanish outside the classroom during the semester (hours), gender, entrance Oral Proficiency Interview, exit Oral Proficiency Interview, and level at which formal instruction began.},

abstract = {This study contributes to the understanding of how language learners make use of a second language, specifically how French English learners make use of the English modals may and can. The study is based on the assumptions that (i) acquiring a new language is a cognitively demanding task which requires the acquirer to identify [a] large amount of co-occurrence data, that (ii) those data are probabilistic in nature rather than absolute, and (iii) that semantic differences are particularly hard to discern and learn as they are not oxplicably noticeable. This study applies Divjak and Grie's (2008) behavioural Profile approach to semantic analysis to a corpus of native and learner English and native French in order to offer a fine-grained quantitative investigation of the co-occurrence patterns of may and can in both English varieties. It shows not only that may and can can be characterised and differentiated on the basis of their co-occurrence patterns, but also that such co-occurrence patterns vary systematically in native English and French-English interlanguage. This finding is supported by monofactorial and multifactorial statistical results indicating that (i) the meanings and the functions of may and can in both English varieties are correlated with the distributions of formal elements within their contexts of occurrence and (ii) that the uses of may and can activate different linguistic levels simultaneously. Generally, these results suggest that the grammatical context of the forms' occurrences presents processing constraints that influence and ultimately characterise learners' choices of may and can. More specifically, the study identifies six grammatical components that systematically trigger the use of may and can in a non-native fashion. Overall, the study shows that (i) it is possible to predict learner language on the basis of corpus-based and psychologically-informed hypotheses on the processing and the acquisition of lexical items of second language learners.},

The article outlines five conditions where there is evidence that intutions tend to be faulty:

1. Social intervention: idealization based on social norms (participants need not be aware of social stigma)
2. Physical collapse: near-mergers in phonological change clearly demonstrate this condition
3. Semantic suspension: collapse of semantic distinction, may co-occur with physical collapse or in isolation (collapse of preterit and perfect in German, example)
4. Cognitive interference: cognitive strategies determine linguistic preferences (--lacking evidence here, but working memory constraints seem like an example of this).
5. Pragamatic opacity: when pragmatic function is is inconsistent with over recognition by speakers usage.

We analyze a commonly-observed process of historical language change: The loss of inflected forms in favour of `analytic' periphrastic constructions. These tendencies are observed in parallel translations of the Book of Genesis in Old English and Modern English. We show that there are significant differences in the frequency distributions of the two texts, and that parts of these differences are independent of total number of words, style of translation, orthography or contents. We argue that they derive instead from the trade-off between synthetic inflectional marking in Old English and analytic constructions in Modern English. By exploiting the earliest ideas of Zipf, we show that the syntheticity of the language in these texts can be captured mathematically, a property we tentatively call their grammatical fingerprint. Our findings suggest implications for both the specific historical process of inflection loss and more generally for the characterization of languages based on statistical properties.},

In Experiment 1, high- and low-frequency target words were embedded in nonconstraining sentence contexts. In Experiment 2, the same participants read high- and low-frequency target words that were either predictable or unpredictable, embedded in highly constraining sentence contexts. Results indicated that when target words appeared in highly constraining sentence contexts, the average readers showed different effects of frequency and predictability from those shown in the highly skilled readers. It appears that reading skill can interact with predictability to affect the word recognition processes used during silent reading.},

- Conserving Effect (repetition leads to increased lexical strength or entrenchment, ex. maintainence of irregular forms in frequent linguistic units: lexical 'weep/ wept' or syntactic English pronouns conserve case, full NPs have not, also verbal auxiliaries undergo inversion, other verbs do not)

Type Frequency Effect

- Type Frequency (type frequency determines productivity, ex. ditransitive construction: double object giving way to prepositional object construction as increasingly more types are associated with prepositional object constructions.

The main finding is the presence of a [- definite] trend in the corpus, whereby definite references tend to be translated by indefinite references.

Our paper extends this observation, arguing that the cross-linguistic study of both grammaticality and frequency contrasts can be crucial to the proper characterization of patterns of diachronic change. As an illustration of this proposal, we investigate patterns of synchronic and diachronic variation in the use of postverbal negative quantifiers (e.g., nothing, nobody, no book, etc., as in, I know nothing) versus negative polarity items under negation (e.g., not {\ldots} anything, not {\ldots} anybody, not {\ldots} any book, etc., as in, I don't know anything) in English. We show how a detailed comparison with similar patterns found elsewhere in closely related languages can give us a better understanding of which linguistic factors condition the use of these different kinds of indefinites in Modern Spoken English and a new perspective on a well-studied proposed change in progress in the English quantificational system.

abstract = {There is mounting evidence that language users are sensitive to distributional information at many grain-sizes. Much of this research has focused on the distributional properties of words, the units they consist of (morphemes, phonemes), and the syntactic structures they appear in (verb-categorization frames, syntactic constructions). In a series of studies we show that comprehenders are also sensitive to the frequencies of compositional four-word phrases (e.g. don't have to worry): more frequent phrases are processed faster. The effect is not reducible to the frequency of the individual words or substrings and is observed across the entire frequency range (for low, mid and high frequency phrases). Comprehenders seem to learn and store frequency information about multi-word phrases. These findings call for processing models that can capture and predict phrase-frequency effects and support accounts where linguistic knowledge consists of patterns of varying sizes and levels of abstraction. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This article deals with multi-word expressions and made me think of a couple research questions:

1) Lexical diversity, frequency scores and frequency effects
Underlines how 'frequency' as a score is a function of the lexical diversity of a corpus. Arnon {\&} Snider do not discuss how their results might differ if the lexical diversity of the corpus was lower -- note, that they do use the Switchboard {\&} Fisher corpus (which is lower in lexical diversity) but they select 4 grams, which be their nature will be more diverse that the unigram frequencies of the corpus. Even then, a more lexically diverse sample (written) would produce even more diverse 4 grams (I suppose)

2) Sub-syntactic (chunks). 
I started thinking about the possibility of linking my satiation studies thinking about multi-word frequency measures as a way to see how predictable some sub-structures are and to what degree the whole syntactic meaning could be predicted based on this sub-structural information.},

abstract = {We present our experience in applying distributional semantics (neural word embeddings) to the problem of representing and clustering documents in a bilingual comparable corpus. Our data is a collection of Russian and Ukrainian academic texts, for which topics are their academic fields. In order to build language-independent semantic representations of these documents, we train neural distributional models on monolingual corpora and learn the optimal linear transformation of vectors from one language to another. The resulting vectors are then used to produce 'semantic fingerprints' of documents, serving as input to a clustering algorithm. The presented method is compared to several baselines including 'orthographic translation' with Levenshtein edit distance and outperforms them by a large margin. We also show that language-independent 'semantic fingerprints' are superior to multi-lingual clustering algorithms proposed in the previous work, at the same time requiring less linguistic resources.},

abstract = {Continuous space language models have re- cently demonstrated outstanding results across a variety of tasks. In this paper, we ex- amine the vector-space word representations that are implicitly learned by the input-layer weights. We find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, “King - Man + Woman” results in a vector very close to “Queen.” We demonstrate that the word vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions (provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40{\%} of the questions. We demonstrate that the word vectors capture semantic regu- larities by using the vector offset method to answer SemEval-2012 Task 2 questions. Re- markably, this method outperforms the best previous systems. 1},

abstract = {Does the language you speak affect how you think about the world? This question is taken up in three experiments. English and Mandarin talk about time differently--English predominantly talks about time as if it were horizontal, while Mandarin also commonly describes time as vertical. This difference between the two languages is reflected in the way their speakers think about time. In one study, Mandarin speakers tended to think about time vertically even when they were thinking for English (Mandarin speakers were faster to confirm that March comes earlier than April if they had just seen a vertical array of objects than if they had just seen a horizontal array, and the reverse was true for English speakers). Another study showed that the extent to which Mandarin-English bilinguals think about time vertically is related to how old they were when they first began to learn English. In another experiment native English speakers were taught to talk about time using vertical spatial terms in a way similar to Mandarin. On a subsequent test, this group of English speakers showed the same bias to think about time vertically as was observed with Mandarin speakers. It is concluded that (1) language is a powerful tool in shaping thought about abstract domains and (2) one's native language plays an important role in shaping habitual thought (e.g., how one tends to think about time) but does not entirely determine one's thinking in the strong Whorfian sense.},

However, the grid-based approach suffers from sparse data problems if one wants to improve classification accuracy by mov- ing to smaller cell sizes.

This paper aims to address an apparent gap in the literature concerning the study of code-switching in computer-mediated communication in English/Spanish. Using (small samples of) blogs, emails and social media (Facebook/ Twitter --specific user accounts), the author categorizes CS language into various categories. Of these categories, the one that is most-highly associated with all language sources (registers) is culturally-bound switches [isolated nouns, idiomatic expressions, discourse and identity markers].

abstract = {Categorization and the judgement of similarity are fundamental in cognition. We propose that these and other activities are based upon an underlying structure of knowledge, or concept representation, in the brain. Further, we propose that this structure can be represented mathematically in a declarative form via category theory, the mathematical theory of structure. We test the resulting mathematical model in an experiment in which human subjects provide judgements of similarity for pairs of line drawings using a numerical scale to represent degrees of similarity. The resulting numerical similarities are compared with those derived from the category-theoretic model by comparing diagrams. The diagrams represent distributed concept structures underlying the line draw- ings. To compare with a more conventional analysis technique, we also compare the human judgements with those provided by a two-dimensional feature space model equipped with a distance metric for the line drawings. The results are equally favorable for both models. Because of this and the putative explanatory power of the category-theoretic model, we propose that this model is worthy of further exploration as a mathematical model for cognitive science.

An informational theory of the dative alternation is supported by the results of a corpus study on the distribution of person across dative NP and PP recipients in spoken English, and a formal model of the theory is given within the framework of stochastic Optimality Theory.},

Word embeddings show promise as a diachronic tool, but have not been carefully evaluated. We develop a robust methodology for quantifying semantic change by evaluating word embeddings (PPMI, SVD, word2vec) against known historical changes. We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity---the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation---independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.},

This development has led to the collection of processing times and subjective ratings (of age of acquisition, concreteness, valence, and arousal) for most of the existing words in English and Dutch. In addition, a crowdsourcing study in the Dutch language has resulted in information about how well 52,000 lemmas are known. This information is likely to be of interest to NLP researchers and computational linguists. At the same time, large-scale measures of word characteristics developed in the latter traditions are likely to be pivotal in bringing the megastudy approach to the next level.},

abstract = {Collocations in the sense of idiosyncratic binary lexical co-occurrences are one of the biggest challenges for any language learner. Even advanced learners make collocation mistakes in that they literally translate collocation elements from their native tongue, create new words as collocation elements, choose a wrong subcategorization for one of the elements, etc. Therefore, automatic collocation error detection and correction is increasingly in demand. However, while state-of-the-art models predict, with a reasonable accuracy, whether a given co-occurrence is a valid collocation or not, only few of them manage to suggest appropriate corrections with an acceptable hit rate. Most often, a ranked list of correction options is offered from which the learner has then to choose. This is clearly unsatisfactory. Our proposal focuses on this critical part of the problem in the context of the acquisition of Spanish as second language. For collocation error detection, we use a frequency-based technique. To improve on collocation error correction, we discuss three different metrics with respect to their capability to select the most appropriate correction of miscollocations found in our learner corpus. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alterna-tive to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of " Canada " and " Air " cannot be easily combined to obtain " Air Canada " . Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

abstract = {It is widely agreed upon that linguistic predictions are an integral part of language comprehension. Yet, experimental proof of their existence remains challenging. Here, we introduce a new predictive eye gaze reading task combining eye tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that allows us to infer the existence and timing of linguistic predictions via anticipatory eye-movements. Participants read different types of word sequences (i.e., regular sentences, meaningless jabberwocky sentences, non-word lists) up to the pre-final word. The final target word was displayed with a temporal delay and its screen position was dependent on the syntactic word category (nouns vs verbs). During the delay, anticipatory eye-movements into the correct target word area were indicative of linguistic predictions. For fMRI analysis, the predictive sentence conditions were contrasted to the non-word condition, with the anticipatory eye-movements specifying differences in timing across conditions. A conjunction analysis of both sentence conditions revealed the neural substrate of word category prediction, namely a distributed network of cortical and subcortical brain regions including language systems, basal ganglia, thalamus, and hippocampus. Direct contrasts between the regular sentence condition and the jabberwocky condition indicate that prediction of word category in meaningless jabberwocky sentences relies on classical left-hemispheric language systems involving Brodman's area 44/45 in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal areas, and the dorsal caudate nucleus. Regular sentences, in contrast, allowed for the prediction of specific words. Word-specific predictions were specifically associated with more widely distributed temporal and parietal cortical systems, most prominently in the right hemisphere. Our results support the presence of linguistic predictions during sentence processing and demonstrate the validity of the predictive eye gaze paradigm for measuring syntactic and semantic aspects of linguistic predictions, as well as for investigating their neural substrates.},

abstract = {Mixed language data is one of the difficult yet less explored domains of natural language processing. Most research in fields like machine translation or sentiment analysis assume monolingual input. However, people who are capable of using more than one language often communicate using multiple languages at the same time. Sociolinguists believe this "code-switching" phenomenon to be socially motivated. For example, to express solidarity or to establish authority. Most past work depend on external tools or resources, such as part-of-speech tagging, dictionary look-up, or named-entity recognizers to extract rich features for training machine learning models. In this paper, we train recurrent neural networks with only raw features, and use word embedding to automatically learn meaningful representations. Using the same mixed-language Twitter corpus, our system is able to outperform the best SVM-based systems reported in the EMNLP'14 Code-Switching Workshop by 1{\%} in accuracy, or by 17{\%} in error rate reduction.},

As psychology navigates a period of unprecedented introspection, user-friendly tools and services that support open science have flourished. There has never been a better time to embrace transparent research practices. However, the plethora of decisions and choices involved can be bewildering. Here we provide a practical guide to help researchers navigate the process of preparing and sharing the products of their research. Being an open scientist means adopting a few straightforward research management practices, which lead to less error prone, reproducible research workflows. Further, this adoption can be piecemeal – each incremental step towards complete transparency adds positive value. Transparent research practices not only improve the efficiency of individual researchers, they enhance the credibility of the knowledge generated by the scientific community.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigation was to examine how language proficiency and orthographic transparency (letter-sound mapping consistency) modulate neural activity during bilingual single word reading. Spanish-English bilingual participants, more fluent in their second language (L2; English) than their native language (L1; Spanish), were asked to read words in the two languages. Behavioral results showed that participants were significantly slower in reading words in their less proficient language (Spanish) than in their more proficient language (English). fMRI results also revealed that reading words in the less proficient language yielded greater activity in the articulatory motor system, consisting of supplementary motor area/cingulate, insula, and putamen. Together, the behavioral and fMRI results suggest that the less practiced, hence less proficient, language requires greater articulatory motor effort, which results in slower reading rates. Moreover, we found that orthographic transparency also played a neuromodulatory role. More transparent Spanish words yielded greater activity in superior temporal gyrus (STG; BA 22), a region implicated in phonological processing, and orthographically opaque English words yielded greater activity in visual processing and word recoding regions, such as the occipito-parietal border and inferior parietal lobe (IPL; BA 40). Overall, our fMRI results suggest that the articulatory motor system is more plastic, hence, more amenable to change because of greater exposure to the L2. By contrast, we propose that our orthography effect is less plastic, hence, less influenced by frequency of exposure to a language system.},

abstract = {We propose a new computational approach for tracking and detecting statistically significant linguistic shifts in the meaning and usage of words. Such linguistic shifts are especially prevalent on the Internet, where the rapid exchange of ideas can quickly change a word's meaning. Our meta-analysis approach constructs property time series of word usage, and then uses statistically sound change point detection algorithms to identify significant linguistic shifts. We consider and analyze three approaches of increasing complexity to generate such linguistic property time series, the culmination of which uses distributional characteristics inferred from word co-occurrences. Using recently proposed deep neural language models, we first train vector representations of words for each time period. Second, we warp the vector spaces into one unified coordinate system. Finally, we construct a distance-based distributional time series for each word to track its linguistic displacement over time. We demonstrate that our approach is scalable by tracking linguistic change across years of micro-blogging using Twitter, a decade of product reviews using a corpus of movie reviews from Amazon, and a century of written books using the Google Book Ngrams. Our analysis reveals interesting patterns of language usage change commensurate with each medium.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper is a usage-based study of the grammar of that set of English Relative Clauses with which a relativizer has been described as optional. We argue that the regularities in the use of relativizers in English can be seen as systematically arising from pragmatic-prosodic factors, creating frequency effects, resulting in some cases highly grammaticized formats: the more the Main Clause and the Relative Clause are integrated with each other, that is, approach monoclausal status, the more likely we are to find no relativizer used; conversely, the more separate the two clauses are, the more likely we are to find an overt relativizer. These findings have led us to suggest that the more monoclausal combinations have become unitary storage and processing chunks. We thus see these findings as a contribution not only to our understanding of Relative Clauses, but to our understanding of syntactic organization in general and of the nature of the grammatical practices in which speakers engage in everyday interactions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
annote = {The authors argue that the semantic closeness of the main and relative clauses predicts the use of an overt relativizer: 

No relativizer

- more monoclausal end having an almost empty Main
Clause, simple head NP and short ORC, with highly integrated rhythm, and displaying a range from extreme lexical specificity (memorized chunk) to a somewhat more general pattern with still a fair amount of lexical specificity;

Relativizer

- biclausal pattern tends to be made up of less frequent lexical items, and is less likely to be composed of
pre-stored chunks or low-level formats with lexically specific components. This end of the continuum shows a greater preference for an overt relativizer.},

annote = {The authors discuss reflections on using acceptability judgements to gain insight into dialect variation. They reiterate some of the strengths and weaknesses of using spontaneous speech/ corpora and introspective judgements and then proceed to outline ways to improve on the weaknesses of judgements.

Strengths of speech/ corpora:
- reflect usage (implicit language), provide possible clues to co-varying syntactic variables, appear in cohesive/ communicative contexts

Weaknesses of speech/ corpora:
- construction may be rare (or unattested) and therefore cannot be reliably explored, variables of interest cannot be guaranteed to be present

Strengths of introspection:
- investigators can target specific variables and combinations predicted by a theory to be possible and impossible (negative data), 

Weakeness of introspection:
- Numerous task effects (lexical choice, pragmatic context, processing effects, explicit language attitudes/ bias, etc.

Suggestions for improving introspection (for dialect exploration):

1. Use indirect acceptability judgements (avoid prestige dialect interference).
2. Awareness of the interaction between written forms and dialect usage: prescriptive forms tend to be used in written modality
3. Isolated sentences may lead to a lack of sufficient semantic/ pragmatic cohesiveness. In these cases it is not clear what the participant is judging as they must attempt to contextualize the utterance themselves and this may differ between participants.},

In some cases reported in the literature, inappropriate statistical methods have been used, and statistical significance of results have not been addressed. In particular, asymptotic normality assumptions have often been used unjustifiably, leading to flawed results.This assumption of normal distribution limits the ability to analyze rare events. Unfortunately rare events do make up a large fraction of real text.However, more applicable methods based on likelihood ratio tests are available that yield good results with relatively small samples. These tests can be implemented efficiently, and have been used for the detection of composite terms and for the determination of domain-specific terms. In some cases, these measures perform much better than the methods previously used. In cases where traditional contingency table methods work well, the likelihood ratio tests described here are nearly identical.This paper describes the basis of a measure based on likelihood ratios that can be applied to the analysis of text.},

abstract = {Unsupervised vector-based approaches to semantics can model rich lexical meanings, but they largely fail to capture sentiment information that is central to many word meanings and important for a wide range of NLP tasks. We present a model that uses a mix of unsupervised and supervised techniques to learn word vectors capturing semantic term–document information as well as rich sentiment content. The proposed model can leverage both continuous and multi-dimensional sentiment in- formation as well as non-sentiment annota- tions. We instantiate the model to utilize the document-level sentiment polarity annotations present in many online documents (e.g. star ratings). We evaluate the model using small, widely used sentiment and subjectivity corpora and find it out-performs several previously introduced methods for sentiment classification. We also introduce a large dataset of movie reviews to serve as a more robust benchmark for work in this area.},

Getting Started with R is now the go-to introductory guide for biologists wanting to learn how to use R in their research. It teaches readers how to import, explore, graph, and analyse data, while keeping them focused on their ultimate goals: clearly communicating their data in oral presentations, posters, papers, and reports. It provides a consistent workflow for using R that is simple, efficient, reliable, and reproducible. This second edition has been updated and expanded while retaining the concise and engaging nature of its predecessor, offering an accessible and fun introduction to the packages dplyr and ggplot2 for data manipulation and graphing. It expands the set of basic statistics considered in the first edition to include new examples of a simple regression, a one-way and a two-way ANOVA. Finally, it introduces a new chapter on the generalised linear model. Getting Started with R is suitable for undergraduates, graduate students, professional researchers, and practitioners in the biological sciences.},

At the same time we note the limits of this predictability: low-frequency items, as noted elsewhere in the literature, often enjoy high levels of acceptability. Statistical preemption thus appears as a more limited phenomenon than had heretofore been posited.},

abstract = {Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a theory and method for extracting and representing the contextual-usage meaning of words by statistical computations applied to a large corpus of text (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). The underlying idea is that the aggregate of all the word contexts in which a given word does and does not appear provides a set of mutual constraints that largely determines the similarity of meaning of words and sets of words to each other. The adequacy of LSA's reflection of human knowledge has been established in a variety of ways. For example, its scores overlap those of humans on standard vocabulary and subject matter tests; it mimics human word sorting and category judgments; it simulates word–word and passage–word lexical priming data; and, as reported in 3 following articles in this issue, it accurately estimates passage coherence, learnability of passages by individual students, and the quality and quantity of knowledge contained in an essay.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Within the structural and grammatical bounds of a common language, all authors develop their own distinctive writing styles. Whether the relative occurrence of common words can be measured to produce accurate models of authorship is of particular interest. This work introduces a new score that helps to highlight such variations in word occurrence, and is applied to produce models of authorship of a large group of plays from the Shakespearean era.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY: A text corpus containing 55,055 unique words was generated from 168 plays from the Shakespearean era (16th and 17th centuries) of undisputed authorship. A new score, CM1, is introduced to measure variation patterns based on the frequency of occurrence of each word for the authors John Fletcher, Ben Jonson, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare, compared to the rest of the authors in the study (which provides a reference of relative word usage at that time). A total of 50 WEKA methods were applied for Fletcher, Jonson and Middleton, to identify those which were able to produce models yielding over 90{\%} classification accuracy. This ensemble of WEKA methods was then applied to model Shakespearean authorship across all 168 plays, yielding a Matthews' correlation coefficient (MCC) performance of over 90{\%}. Furthermore, the best model yielded an MCC of 99{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that different authors, while adhering to the structural and grammatical bounds of a common language, develop measurably distinct styles by the tendency to over-utilise or avoid particular common words and phrasings. Considering language and the potential of words as an abstract chaotic system with a high entropy, similarities can be drawn to the Maxwell's Demon thought experiment; authors subconsciously favour or filter certain words, modifying the probability profile in ways that could reflect their individuality and style.},

In particular, methods from corpus linguistics are now frequently used to study distributional characteristics of linguistics units and what they reveal about cognitive and psycholinguistic processes. This paper surveys a range of psycholinguistic notions that are becoming ever more important in theoretical and cognitive linguistics—for example, frequency, entrenchment, dispersion, contingency, surprisal, Zipfian distributions—and current corpus-linguistic approaches toward exploring these notions and their roles for linguistic cognition.},

abstract = {Individual happiness is a fundamental societal metric. Normally measured through self-report, happiness has often been indirectly characterized and overshadowed by more readily quantifiable economic indicators such as gross domestic product. Here, we examine expressions made on the online, global microblog and social networking service Twitter, uncovering and explaining temporal variations in happiness and information levels over timescales ranging from hours to years. Our data set comprises over 46 billion words contained in nearly 4.6 billion expressions posted over a 33 month span by over 63 million unique users. In measuring happiness, we construct a tunable, real-time, remote-sensing, and non-invasive, text-based hedonometer. In building our metric, made available with this paper, we conducted a survey to obtain happiness evaluations of over 10,000 individual words, representing a tenfold size improvement over similar existing word sets. Rather than being ad hoc, our word list is chosen solely by frequency of usage, and we show how a highly robust and tunable metric can be constructed and defended.},

abstract = {Quantifying the degree of spatial dependence for linguistic variables is a key task for analyzing dialectal variation. However, existing approaches have important drawbacks. First, they make unjustified assumptions about the nature of spatial variation: some assume that the geographical distribution of linguistic variables is Gaussian, while others assume that linguistic variation is aligned to pre-defined geopolitical units such as states or counties. Second, they are not applicable to all types of linguistic data: some approaches apply only to frequencies, others to boolean indicators of whether a linguistic variable is present. We present a new method for measuring geographical language variation, which solves both of these problems. Our approach builds on reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) representations for nonparametric statistics, and takes the form of a test statistic that is computed from pairs of individual geotagged observations without aggregation into predefined geographical bins. We compare this test with prior work using synthetic data as well as a diverse set of real datasets: a corpus of Dutch tweets, a Dutch syntactic atlas, and a dataset of letters to the editor in North American newspapers. Our proposed test is shown to support robust inferences across a broad range of scenarios and types of data.},

abstract = {We report five experiments that investigate syntactic priming (Bock, 1986b) using a written completion task. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that priming occurs if the prime and target contain different verbs, but that stronger priming occurs if the verb is repeated. Experiment 1 also showed that priming occurs even if the detailed structure of prime and target differ. Experiments 3, 4, and 5 found that priming was unaffected by whether tense, aspect, or number of the verb stayed the same or differed between prime and target. We argue that these results provide evidence about the representation of syntactic information within the lemma stratum. We use these results to extend the model proposed by Roelofs (1992, 1993). In particular, we argue that combinatorial information is phrasal in nature, is associated with the verb's lemma rather than a particular form of the verb, and is shared between different lemmas.

In this paper, we compare these data acquisition techniques and quantify the biases that they introduce; we also measure their effects on linguistic analysis and text-based geolocation. GPS-tagging and self-reported locations yield measurably different corpora, and these linguistic differences are partially attributable to differences in dataset composition by age and gender. Using a latent variable model to induce age and gender, we show how these demographic variables interact with geography to affect language use. We also show that the accuracy of text-based geolocation varies with population demographics, giving the best results for men above the age of 40.},

In this paper, we describe our work in progress on the problem of automatic language identification for the language of social media. We describe a new dataset that we are in the process of creating, which contains Facebook posts and comments that exhibit code mixing between Bengali, English and Hindi. We also present some preliminary word-level language identification experiments using this dataset. Different techniques are employed, including a simple unsupervised dictionary-based approach, supervised word-level classification with and without contextual clues, and sequence labelling using Conditional Random Fields. We find that the dictionary-based approach is surpassed by supervised classification and sequence labelling, and that it is important to take contextual clues into consideration.},

abstract = {“Everyone knows that language is variable.” This is the bald sentence with which Sapir (1921:147) begins his chapter on language as an historical product. He goes on to emphasize how two speakers' usage is bound to differ “in choice of words, in sentence structure, in the relative frequency with which particular forms or combinations of words are used”. I should add that much sociolinguistic and historical linguistic research has shown that the same speaker's usage is also variable (Labov 1966, Kroch 2001:722). However, the tradition of most syntacticians has been to ignore this thing that everyone knows.1},

abstract = {This article presents the problem of diacritic restoration (or diacritization) in the context of spell-checking, with the focus on an ortho- graphically rich language such as Spanish. We argue that despite the large volume of work published on the topic of diacritization, currently available spell-checking tools have still not found a proper solution to the problem in those cases where both forms of a word are listed in the checker's dictionary. This is the case, for instance, when a word form exists with and without diacritics, such as continuo ‘continuous' and continu´ o ‘he/she/it continued', or when different diacritics make other word distinctions, as in contin´ We propose a very simple solution based on a word bigram model derived from correctly typed Spanish texts and evaluate the ability of this model to restore diacritics in artificial as well as real errors. The case of diacritics is only meant to be an example of the possible applications for this idea, yet we believe that the same method could be applied to other kinds of orthographic or even grammatical errors. Moreover, given that no explicit linguistic knowledge is required, the proposed model can be used with other languages provided that a large normative corpus is available.},

Even the commas are not absolutely required. The strength of preference for them depends on how heavy the modifiers are: cf. strength judicially applied increases the effectiveness of diplomacy, a cup of peanuts unshelled in the stock adds character. 3 In short, the structure (3) seems to be best characterized as grammatical, though it violates any number of parsing preferences and is completely absurd.

Subjects in the control group rated unrelated sentences during the exposure period before rating the experimental sentences. Subjects in the Experimental group rated both grammatical and ungrammatical sentences as more acceptable after repeated evaluation than subjects in the Control group. In Experiment 2, subjects answered a comprehension question after reading each sentence during the exposure period. Subjects in the experimental group rated garden path and center-embedded (1) sentences as higher in acceptability after comprehension exposure than subjects in the control group. The results are consistent with increased fluency of comprehension being misattributed as a change in acceptability.},

Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 133, 283-316] studied lexical processing in word naming and lexical decision using hierarchical multiple regression techniques for a large data set of monosyllabic, morphologically simple words. The present study supplements their work by making use of more flexible regression techniques that are better suited for dealing with collinearity and non-linearity, and by documenting the contributions of several variables that they did not take into account. In particular, we included measures of morphological connectivity, as well as a new frequency count, the frequency of a word in speech rather than in writing. The morphological measures emerged as strong predictors in visual lexical decision, but not in naming, providing evidence for the importance of morphological connectivity even for the recognition of morphologically simple words. Spoken frequency was predictive not only for naming but also for visual lexical decision. In addition, it co-determined subjective frequency estimates and norms for age of acquisition. Finally, we show that frequency predominantly reflects conceptual familiarity rather than familiarity with a word's form. ?? 2006.},

In this article, I survey work over the last 20 years that emphasises the contributions of individ-ual learning, cultural transmission, and biological evolution to explaining the structural design features of language. These 3 complex adaptive systems exist in a network of interactions: individual learning biases shape the dynamics of cultural evo-lution; universal features of linguistic structure arise from this cultural process and form the ultimate linguistic phenotype; the nature of this phenotype affects the fitness landscape for the biological evolution of the language faculty; and in turn this determines individuals' learning bias. Using a combina-tion of computational simulation, laboratory experiments, and comparison with real-world cases of language emergence, I show that linguistic structure emerges as a natural outcome of cultural evolution once certain minimal biological require-ments are in place.},

abstract = {Reaction times (rts) are an important source of information in experimental psychology. Classical methodological considerations pertaining to the sta- tistical analysis of rt data are optimized for analyses of aggregated data, based on subject or item means (c.f., Forster {\&} Dickinson, 1976). Mixed- effects modeling (see, e.g., Baayen, Davidson, {\&} Bates, 2008) does not re- quire prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. Mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. In this study, we argue for empirical flexibility with respect to the choice of transforma- tion for the rts. We advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. We also show how trial-to-trial, longitudinal depen- dencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. These strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure. Special attention is paid to the evaluation of in- teractions involving fixed-effect factors that partition the levels sampled by random-effect factors.},

abstract = {Integrating research on multilingualism and computer-mediated communication, this paper proposes the term networked multilingualism' and presents findings from a case study to explore its implications for the theorising of multilingualism. Networked multilingualism is a cover term for multilingual practices that are shaped by two interrelated processes: being networked, i.e. digitally connected to other individuals and groups, and being in the network, i.e. embedded in the global mediascape of the web. It encompasses everything language users do with the entire range of linguistic resources within three sets of constraints: mediation of written language by digital technologies, access to network resources, and orientation to networked audiences. The empirical part of the paper discusses the Facebook language practices of a small group of Greek-background secondary school students in a German city. Data collection follows an online ethnography approach, which combines systematic observation of online activities, collection and linguistic analysis of screen data, and data elicited through direct contact with users. Focusing on four weeks of discourse on profile walls, the analysis examines the participants' linguistic repertoires, their language choices for genres of self-presentation and dialogic exchange, and the performance of multilingual talk online. The findings suggest that the students' networked multilingual practices are individualised, genre-shaped, and based on wide and stratified repertoires.},

These contradictions can arise from basing global conclusions on restricted methodologies-such as assigning undue weight to individual linguistic features, or to choice of particular text samples and text types. The present study uses a 'multi-feature/multi-dimension' approach, which includes a broad range of linguistic features and text types in a single quantitative analysis, to provide a global description of similarities and differences among spoken/written text types in English. The distribution of 41 linguistic features in 545 text samples of approximately 2000 words each is subjected to factor analysis (a multivariate statistical technique). Three underlying textual dimensions are identified: Interactive vs. Edited Text, Abstract vs. Situated Content, and Reported vs. Immediate Style. To demonstrate the value of the multi-feature/multi-dimension approach, the specific findings of earlier studies are reconciled within the model proposed here.},
