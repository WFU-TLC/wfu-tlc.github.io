  - What have work have I worked completed since last session?
  - What questions still remains before next session?
  - What _kind_ of analysis you will be doing? 
  - What do you want to deliver at the end of the final session?
  
- Example to work through (Jerid to complete)
  - Couple of very similfied text data
  - Thing about the statistical inferences one can make
    - Exploratory
    - Inference
    - Prediction
  
- Finish 10 minutes before time and write reflection about (and build the website and push to GH):
  - what have we talked about today, 
  - what questions do you remaining that were raised today or you hope will be reaised in a future meeting? 
  - What future progress do you hope to finish in the next sessions? 
  
## Future Sessions

- Early focus on the discussion board and reprex (reproducible examples)
- Better discussion board functionality
  - text2discuss
- Early focus on integrating Rmarkdown/ prose/ use of the website as a way to work through problems (and share)
